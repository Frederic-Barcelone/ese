# LIGHT NOISE FILTERING (High Recall - Let Validation Layer Judge)

# Philosophy: Generators should be EXHAUSTIVE. Only block OBVIOUS noise.
# Claude (D_validation) will handle borderline cases with context awareness.

# =============================================================================
# BAD LONG FORMS
# =============================================================================
# Long forms that are ALWAYS wrong (regardless of short form)
# These are UMLS artifacts or clearly incorrect expansions
bad_long_forms:
  - "product"  # Too generic, SNOMED artifact
  - "musk secretion from musk deer"  # Wrong MuSK expansion
  - "essential thrombocythemia"  # Often wrong in clinical trial context
  - "ambulatory care facilities"  # Wrong expansion for "Clinic"
  - "simultaneous"  # Wrong expansion for "CONCOMITANT"
  - "kit dosing unit"  # Wrong expansion for "Kits"
  - "medical devices"  # Wrong expansion for "Device"
  - "planum polare"  # Wrong expansion for "PP" (usually Per Protocol)
  - "follicle stimulating hormone injectable"  # Wrong for FSH in most contexts
  - "multiple sulfatase deficiency"  # MSD in pharma context = Merck Sharp & Dohme


# =============================================================================
# WRONG EXPANSION BLACKLIST
# =============================================================================
# Some UMLS/lexicon entries have clearly wrong or contextually inappropriate
# expansions. These SF -> LF pairs should never be used.
#
# Format: [short_form_lower, bad_long_form_lower]
wrong_expansion_blacklist:
  # UMLS mapping errors
  - ["task", "product"]  # TASK in protocols = schedule/activity, not SNOMED "product"
  - ["musk", "musk secretion from musk deer"]  # MuSK = muscle-specific kinase
  # Clinical trial context - these expansions are wrong in protocol context
  - ["et", "essential thrombocythemia"]  # ET in protocols = Early Termination
  - ["sc", "subcutaneous"]  # Often correct, but sometimes wrong
  # Generic wrong mappings
  - ["exam", "examination"]  # Too generic, not an abbreviation
  - ["dose", "dosage"]  # Too generic
  - ["task", "kcnk3 gene"]  # TASK is not usually a gene reference in protocols
