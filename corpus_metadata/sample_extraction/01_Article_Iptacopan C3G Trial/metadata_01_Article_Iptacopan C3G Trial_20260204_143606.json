  "long_description": "This multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 study (APPEAR-C3G) investigated iptacopan, an oral complement inhibitor targeting factor B to selectively inhibit the alternative complement pathway, in 74 adult patients with biopsy-confirmed C3 glomerulopathy. The study was conducted across 35 hospitals in 18 countries and included a 6-month double-blind treatment period followed by a 6-month open-label extension. The primary endpoint was relative reduction in proteinuria measured by 24-hour urine protein-creatinine ratio at 6 months. Results demonstrated a significant 35.1% relative reduction in proteinuria with iptacopan compared to placebo (p=0.0014), with the treatment showing a favorable safety profile and no meningococcal infections reported.",
