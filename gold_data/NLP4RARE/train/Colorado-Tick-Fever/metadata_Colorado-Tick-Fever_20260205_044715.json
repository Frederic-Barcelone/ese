  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Colorado Tick Fever, a rare viral disease caused by a Coltivirus transmitted through wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni) bites. The document covers the disease's epidemiology, noting its prevalence in the Rocky Mountain region and western Canadian provinces, clinical presentation including fever, headaches, muscle aches, and myalgia, and its typical self-limiting course lasting approximately one week. The text emphasizes that while several hundred cases are reported annually in endemic areas, many cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed, suggesting the actual incidence may be higher than reported statistics indicate.",
