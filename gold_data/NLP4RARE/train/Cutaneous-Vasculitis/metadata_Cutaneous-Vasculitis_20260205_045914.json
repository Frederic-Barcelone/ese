  "short_description": "Clinical document describing cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis, a blood vessel inflammation disorder affecting the skin with various manifestations and diagnostic approaches.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis (CNV), a common inflammatory disorder affecting blood vessel walls that presents with diverse skin manifestations. The document details the characteristic skin lesions including macules, nodules, purpura, and potential complications such as ulcers and blistering. It covers the clinical presentation, affected demographics (equal gender distribution across all ages), symptom patterns, and associated systemic symptoms like fever and joint pain. The document emphasizes the importance of skin biopsy for definitive diagnosis and highlights the need for additional organ system testing to differentiate CNV from more severe systemic vasculitides that may involve multiple organ systems beyond the skin.",
