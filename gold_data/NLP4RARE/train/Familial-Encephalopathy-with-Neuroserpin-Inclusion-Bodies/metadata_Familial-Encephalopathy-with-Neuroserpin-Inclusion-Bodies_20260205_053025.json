  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Familial Encephalopathy with Neuroserpin Inclusion Bodies (FENIB), a rare genetic degenerative disorder that affects the brain and spinal cord. The condition presents with distinctive clinical features including poor attention and concentration, declining academic or work performance, and progressive language difficulties that eventually lead to dementia. Unlike Alzheimer's disease, FENIB patients maintain relatively preserved memory function in the early stages. Additional symptoms may include muscle contractions, seizures, and mood changes such as apathy, depression, or anger. The disorder affects both sexes equally, has variable age of onset from childhood to middle age, and was first described in medical literature in 1999. Only a few families worldwide have been reported with this condition, making it extremely rare with unknown population incidence.",
