  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of psoriatic arthritis, detailing its presentation as a rheumatoid-like arthritic condition characterized by joint pain and inflammation occurring alongside psoriatic skin manifestations. The document covers key clinical features including gray skin discoloration, scaly plaques, and nail abnormalities, noting that skin symptoms typically precede arthritis development by several years. It addresses the unknown etiology of the condition and provides epidemiological data indicating that 5-40% of psoriasis patients develop psoriatic arthritis, with higher prevalence in women and typical onset between ages 20-50, though it can occur at any age.",
