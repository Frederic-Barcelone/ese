  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical document describing hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder that develops in individuals with liver disease, ranging from subtle symptoms to life-threatening complications.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a detailed overview of hepatic encephalopathy, a complex neurological disorder that occurs when the liver fails to clear toxins from the blood, allowing them to accumulate and affect brain function. The document covers the spectrum of disease presentation from asymptomatic cases to severe forms causing coma, explains the underlying pathophysiology involving toxin accumulation and portosystemic shunting, and outlines the diagnostic approach including clinical evaluation, laboratory tests (liver function tests, serum ammonia levels), electroencephalography, and neuroimaging techniques. The document emphasizes that many symptoms are reversible with prompt detection and treatment, making it a valuable resource for healthcare professionals managing patients with liver disease.",
