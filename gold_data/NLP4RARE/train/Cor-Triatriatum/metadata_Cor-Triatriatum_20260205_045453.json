  "short_description": "Clinical overview of cor triatriatum, an extremely rare congenital heart defect characterized by an extra chamber above the left atrium that can lead to congestive heart failure.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of cor triatriatum, a rare congenital heart defect affecting 0.1-0.4% of infants with congenital heart disease. The condition involves the presence of an additional chamber above the left atrium, which receives blood from the pulmonary veins and restricts blood flow from the lungs to the heart. The document covers the anatomical abnormality, potential complications including congestive heart failure and obstruction, epidemiology showing equal prevalence in males and females, and diagnostic approaches including MRI, echocardiography, cardiac catheterization, angiography, and EKG patterns. While the exact etiology remains unknown, the document serves as an educational resource for understanding this extremely rare cardiac malformation.",
