In the USA, this disorder accounts for an extremely small percentage (0.1% to 0.4%) of all infants with congenital heart disease. The diagnosis of cor triatriatum is usually made by using imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and echocardiography (EC). In another procedure known as a cardiac catheterization, a long fine tube (catheter) is inserted into a large vein and then channeled directly into the heart. This allows the physician to further identify heart defects and to determine the rates of blood flow through the heart. Angiography is also a very useful diagnostic procedure and allows the physician to view an en",
