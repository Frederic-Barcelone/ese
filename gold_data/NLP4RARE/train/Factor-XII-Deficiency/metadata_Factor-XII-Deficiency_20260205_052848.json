  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Factor XII deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder that disproportionately affects individuals of Asian descent. The text discusses the equal gender distribution of the condition, notes that most cases remain undiagnosed due to the typically asymptomatic nature of the deficiency, and provides population incidence estimates of approximately 1 in 1 million individuals. This information is valuable for understanding the demographic patterns and diagnostic challenges associated with this coagulation disorder.",
