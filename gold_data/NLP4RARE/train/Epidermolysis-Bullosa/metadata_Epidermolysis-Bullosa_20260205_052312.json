  "long_description": "This document provides essential clinical information about epidermolysis bullosa (EB), a rare genetic blistering disorder affecting approximately 1 in 50,000 live births across all racial and ethnic groups. The content emphasizes the challenges in neonatal diagnosis, as all EB types may present similarly in newborns and can be confused with other blistering conditions such as herpes simplex virus, epidermolytic ichthyosis, bullous impetigo, and incontinentia pigmenti. The document outlines the importance of proper diagnostic procedures, including skin biopsy with transmission electron microscopy and immunofluorescent antibody/antigen mapping, as well as the availability of molecular genetic testing for EB-associated gene mutations.",
