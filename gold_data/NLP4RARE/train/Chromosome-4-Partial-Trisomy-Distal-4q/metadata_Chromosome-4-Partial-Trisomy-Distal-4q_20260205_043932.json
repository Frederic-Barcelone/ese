  "title": "Chromosome 4, Partial Trisomy Distal 4q: Clinical Overview and Characteristics",
  "short_description": "Clinical documentation of a rare chromosomal disorder involving partial trisomy of the distal portion of chromosome 4, affecting growth, development, and multiple organ systems.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 4, Partial Trisomy Distal 4q, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of three copies of a portion of chromosome 4 instead of the normal two copies. The document details the variable clinical presentation including growth deficiency, intellectual disability, distinctive craniofacial malformations such as microcephaly and malformed ears, and limb defects. It also covers associated complications including congenital heart defects, genitourinary abnormalities, and other systemic manifestations. The document discusses the genetic mechanisms underlying the condition, noting that most cases result from balanced chromosomal rearrangements in parents, with rare de novo occurrences. With over 60 documented cases in medical literature, this resource serves as an important reference for understanding the clinical spectrum and genetic basis of this rare chromosomal disorder.",
