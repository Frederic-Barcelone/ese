  "short_description": "Clinical document describing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), their epidemiology, presentation, and relationship to leiomyosarcomas.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), a type of soft tissue sarcoma affecting 5,000-6,000 new patients annually in the United States. The document details the anatomical distribution of these tumors, with the stomach being the most common site followed by small intestine and colon/rectum. It explains the clinical presentation including abdominal pain, bleeding, and intestinal obstruction, as well as metastatic patterns primarily to abdominal cavity and liver. The text discusses the genetic basis involving KIT and PDGFR mutations, distinguishes between sporadic and inherited cases, and provides differential diagnosis information comparing GISTs to leiomyosarcomas of the gastrointestinal tract.",
