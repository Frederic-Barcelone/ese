  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of acanthocheilonemiasis, a rare tropical infectious disease caused by the parasitic nematode Acanthocheilonema perstans (also known as Dipetalonema perstans). The document details the disease's epidemiology, primarily affecting populations in central Africa and parts of South America, its transmission mechanism through small black flies (A. coliroides), and clinical manifestations including pruritus, abdominal and chest pain, myalgia, localized edema, and hepatosplenomegaly. The text also covers diagnostic indicators such as eosinophilia and treatment approaches, including antifilarial medications like ivermectin and diethylcarbamazine, with surgical intervention reserved for severe cases involving large adult worms.",
