  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical document describing Fox-Fordyce disease, a rare skin disorder primarily affecting women and characterized by intense itching in apocrine gland areas.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a detailed overview of Fox-Fordyce disease, a rare dermatological condition that predominantly affects women aged 13-35 years. The document covers the pathophysiology involving apocrine sweat gland abnormalities, characteristic symptoms including intense itching in underarm, pubic, and nipple areas, and associated complications such as skin darkening and hair loss. It discusses epidemiological factors, exacerbating conditions like heat and stress, hormonal influences including menstrual cycle effects and pregnancy resolution, and diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation and histopathological examination. The document serves as a clinical reference for healthcare providers managing this uncommon but significant dermatological disorder first described in 1902.",
