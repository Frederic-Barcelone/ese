  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Achard-Thiers syndrome, a rare endocrine disorder that primarily affects postmenopausal women. The syndrome is characterized by the combination of type 2 insulin-resistant diabetes mellitus and signs of androgen excess. The document discusses the unknown etiology of the condition, its familial transmission patterns with approximately 50% of sisters of affected women showing some form of the syndrome, and diagnostic approaches including the use of oral glucose tolerance tests to identify hyperinsulinemia. The text emphasizes the rarity of the condition and the lack of established population incidence data.",
