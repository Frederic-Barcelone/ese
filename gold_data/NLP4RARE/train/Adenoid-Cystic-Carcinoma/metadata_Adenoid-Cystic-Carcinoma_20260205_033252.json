  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC), a relatively rare malignancy that predominantly affects the salivary glands and head/neck regions but can also occur in other body sites including breast, skin, cervix, and prostate. The document details the characteristic histological features of ACC tumors, including their distinctive pattern of epithelial cell nests and cords that infiltrate glandular structures. It describes ACC as typically a low-grade, slow-growing malignancy that can occasionally become aggressively invasive, with potential for perineural invasion, local recurrence, and metastatic spread to distant sites, particularly the lungs, in approximately 50% of patients. The document also covers the typical age demographics, noting that while ACC commonly occurs in adults aged 40-60, it can also affect children and adolescents.",
