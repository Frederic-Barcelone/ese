  "short_description": "Clinical document describing neonatal herpes simplex virus infection, its transmission, symptoms, and diagnostic challenges in newborn infants.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of neonatal herpes, a rare but serious condition affecting newborn infants infected with herpes simplex virus (HSV). The document explains the transmission pathways from parents to offspring, differentiates between HSV Type 1 and Type 2 presentations, and emphasizes the diagnostic challenges healthcare providers face. It highlights the importance of maintaining clinical suspicion for HSV infection in neonates presenting with non-specific symptoms such as fever, poor feeding, lethargy, or seizures. The document also addresses the need for immediate antiviral treatment when vesicular rashes are present, even before laboratory confirmation is available.",
