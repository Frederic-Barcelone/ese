  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information on the diagnosis of anthrax in its various forms (inhalational, cutaneous, and gastrointestinal). It emphasizes key diagnostic features that differentiate anthrax from similar conditions, particularly influenza and common cold. The text highlights important clinical signs such as the absence of runny nose in anthrax patients, abnormal chest X-rays in inhalational cases, characteristic skin lesions in cutaneous anthrax, and the biphasic nature of inhalational anthrax symptoms. The document also stresses the importance of exposure history to livestock or animal sources in making an accurate diagnosis.",
