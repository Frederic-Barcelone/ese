  "short_description": "Clinical overview of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), a rare but potentially fatal complication affecting pregnant women during or immediately after childbirth.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of amniotic fluid embolism (AFE), an extremely rare obstetric emergency that occurs in approximately 1 in 8,000 to 1 in 80,000 pregnancies. The document explains the current understanding of AFE pathophysiology, which has evolved from theories of mechanical obstruction to recognition of an overwhelming maternal immune response to fetal material entering the bloodstream. It details the unpredictable nature of this condition, its lack of identifiable risk factors, and the severe complications including respiratory distress, cardiac arrest, and hemorrhage that can rapidly develop. The document emphasizes the critical importance of early recognition and prompt supportive treatment for this medical emergency that can be fatal to both mother and fetus.",
