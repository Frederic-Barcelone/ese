  "short_description": "Document detailing the prevalence and epidemiological characteristics of ADNP syndrome, a rare genetic disorder associated with autism spectrum disorders.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides comprehensive epidemiological data on ADNP syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects males and females equally. The document presents prevalence estimates indicating approximately 1 in 20,000 people in the United States and Europe are affected, while noting the challenges in accurate diagnosis that may lead to underreporting. Significantly, the document highlights that ADNP syndrome accounts for about 0.17% of individuals with autism, positioning it as one of the most common single-gene causes of autism spectrum disorders. The document references data from the ADNP Kids Research Foundation, reporting approximately 205 identified affected children worldwide as of January 2019, emphasizing both the rarity of the condition and the ongoing efforts to track and understand its true prevalence in the global population.",
