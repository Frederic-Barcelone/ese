  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Cronkhite-Canada syndrome (CCS), an extremely rare acquired disorder that primarily affects older adults with an average onset age of 59 years. The document details the characteristic clinical features including various intestinal polyps, loss of taste, alopecia, and nail growth abnormalities. It emphasizes the treatment challenges posed by malabsorption complications and discusses the epidemiological patterns, noting the male predominance (3:2 ratio) and sporadic occurrence without hereditary transmission. The document also provides global prevalence data, indicating over 500 reported cases worldwide in the past 50 years, with the highest incidence in Japan but cases also documented in the United States and other countries.",
