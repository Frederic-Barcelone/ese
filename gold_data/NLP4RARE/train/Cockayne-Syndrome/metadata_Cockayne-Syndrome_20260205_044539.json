  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Cockayne Syndrome, a rare inherited form of dwarfism characterized by growth retardation, photosensitivity, and premature aging.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Cockayne Syndrome (CS), a rare inherited disorder affecting fewer than 1 in 250,000 live births. The document outlines the diagnostic criteria based on three key signs: growth retardation leading to short stature, abnormal sensitivity to light (photosensitivity), and prematurely aged appearance (progeria). It details the classification system including four distinct types: classical CS type I with progressive symptoms appearing after age one, congenital CS type II present at birth, milder CS type III with later onset, and XP-CS which combines features of Xeroderma pigmentosa and Cockayne syndrome. The document emphasizes the equal gender distribution and lack of ethnic predisposition, providing epidemiological context with historical case reporting data through 1992.",
