  "short_description": "Clinical overview of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), a progressive motor neuron disease affecting voluntary muscle control and leading to respiratory failure.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. It explains the pathophysiology of this motor neuron disease, detailing how progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons disrupts communication between the nervous system and voluntary muscles. The document covers the disease progression from initial muscle weakness to eventual respiratory failure, and includes epidemiological data showing ALS affects approximately 30,000 people in the United States with 5,000 new diagnoses annually. It notes the demographic patterns, including a median onset age of 55 years and a higher prevalence in males (60%) compared to females (40%).",
