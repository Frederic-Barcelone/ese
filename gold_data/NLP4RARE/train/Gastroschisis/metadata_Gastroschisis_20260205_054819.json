  "long_description": "This document provides essential clinical information about gastroschisis, a congenital condition where abdominal organs protrude through a defect in the abdominal wall. The content details the current prevalence rates of 2-5 cases per 10,000 newborns as of 2015, with CDC estimates indicating approximately 1,871 affected births annually in the United States. The document explains diagnostic approaches including prenatal ultrasound detection and postnatal confirmation, emphasizing the key differential diagnostic feature that distinguishes gastroschisis from omphalocele - the absence of a membranous covering around the protruding organs, which appear freely floating in the amniotic cavity during pregnancy and are visible on the abdominal surface after birth.",
