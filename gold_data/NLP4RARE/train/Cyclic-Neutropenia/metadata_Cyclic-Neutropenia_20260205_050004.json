  "short_description": "Clinical overview of cyclic neutropenia, a rare blood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of abnormally low neutrophil levels.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of cyclic neutropenia, a rare hematological disorder marked by periodic episodes of severely reduced neutrophil counts. The content explains the critical role of neutrophils in immune defense, particularly their function in combating bacterial infections through phagocytosis and destruction of pathogens. The document details the characteristic clinical manifestations including fever, malaise, and oral mucosal ulcerations, while emphasizing the increased susceptibility to recurrent infections that patients experience during neutropenic episodes. This resource serves as an educational reference for understanding the pathophysiology, symptoms, and clinical implications of this uncommon blood disorder.",
