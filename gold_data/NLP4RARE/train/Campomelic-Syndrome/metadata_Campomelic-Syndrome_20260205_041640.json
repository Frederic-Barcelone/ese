  "short_description": "Clinical document describing campomelic syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by skeletal anomalies, facial features, and genital development abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of campomelic syndrome, a rare congenital disorder affecting multiple body systems. The document details the characteristic features including bowing of long bones (particularly the tibia), facial anomalies, cleft palate, skeletal abnormalities such as rib variations and shoulder/pelvic irregularities, tracheal underdevelopment, and incomplete male genital development leading to sex reversal. It discusses the epidemiology, noting the disorder's rarity with approximately 100 reported cases and apparent female predominance that may be skewed by sex reversal cases. The document outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical examination, radiological imaging of various body regions, cardiac and renal ultrasounds, and genetic testing for SOX9 gene mutations.",
