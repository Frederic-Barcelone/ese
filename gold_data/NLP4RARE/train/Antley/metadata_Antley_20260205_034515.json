  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of Antley-Bixler syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with an estimated prevalence of less than 1 in 1,000,000. The condition is characterized by structural changes of the skull and facial bones, most notably premature closure of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis). Affected individuals typically present with distinctive facial features including a prominent forehead, underdeveloped midfacial regions (midfacial hypoplasia), protruding eyes (proptosis), and low-set ears. The document notes that this condition has been described in over 30 patients to date, highlighting its rarity in clinical practice.",
