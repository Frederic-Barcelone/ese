  "short_description": "Clinical document describing De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome, an extremely rare autosomal recessive disorder combining xeroderma pigmentosum features with neurological abnormalities and developmental issues.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of De Sanctis-Cacchione syndrome, a rare genetic disorder first described in 1932. The document details the syndrome's characteristic features including skin and eye symptoms of xeroderma pigmentosum, neurological abnormalities such as microcephaly and ataxia, mental retardation, short stature, and hypogonadism. It covers the disorder's inheritance pattern as an autosomal recessive trait, epidemiology affecting both sexes equally, typical onset during the first year of life, and the rarity of the condition with approximately 200 reported cases in Western medical literature. The document serves as a clinical reference for healthcare professionals dealing with this complex multi-system disorder.",
