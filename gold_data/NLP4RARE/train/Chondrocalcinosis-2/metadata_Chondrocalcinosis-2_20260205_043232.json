  "short_description": "Clinical overview of CCAL2, a rare genetic form of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease affecting joints and spine.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of CCAL2 (Chondrocalcinosis 2), detailing the characteristic symptoms including acute recurring attacks of joint pain, swelling, warmth, and redness, as well as chronic manifestations resembling osteoarthritis. The text covers the typical joints affected (knee, wrist, hip, shoulder), spinal involvement with calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposits around vertebrae, and the epidemiological aspects of this rare disorder. With only eight families documented in medical literature, the document emphasizes the rarity of this genetic condition while noting the lack of clear ethnic predilection and discussing gender prevalence patterns in the broader category of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate deposition disease.",
