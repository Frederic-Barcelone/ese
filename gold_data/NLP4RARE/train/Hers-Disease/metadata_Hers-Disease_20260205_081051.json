  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Hers disease, a rare genetic metabolic disorder caused by liver phosphorylase enzyme deficiency leading to abnormal glycogen accumulation.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Hers disease, a genetic metabolic disorder characterized by deficiency of the liver phosphorylase enzyme. The condition belongs to the glycogen storage disorder family and results in abnormal glycogen accumulation in the body. The document details the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations including hepatomegaly, hypoglycemia, ketosis, and growth retardation, as well as epidemiological data showing higher prevalence in Mennonite populations. It explains that symptoms may not be evident during childhood, allowing affected children to lead normal lives, but may present in adulthood. The document also covers diagnostic approaches, specifically liver biopsy for enzyme activity testing, and provides incidence estimates for glycogen storage diseases in the United States.",
