  "short_description": "Clinical document providing an overview of anaplastic astrocytoma, a rare malignant brain tumor that develops from astrocytes.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document presents fundamental information about anaplastic astrocytoma, a rare type of malignant brain tumor. The document explains that these tumors originate from astrocytes, which are star-shaped brain cells that form protective tissue around nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord. It categorizes anaplastic astrocytomas within the broader classification of gliomas, tumors arising from glial tissue. The document notes that symptoms vary based on tumor location and size, and acknowledges that the specific underlying cause remains unknown. This appears to be an educational or reference document for healthcare professionals or patients seeking to understand this rare neurological condition.",
