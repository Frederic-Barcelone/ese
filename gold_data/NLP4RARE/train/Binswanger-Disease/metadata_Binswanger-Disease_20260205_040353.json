  "title": "Binswanger Disease: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approach",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Binswanger disease as a vascular dementia syndrome caused by reduced blood flow to deep brain structures.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Binswanger disease, explaining it as a clinical syndrome of vascular dementia rather than a specific disease entity. The document details the various underlying causes including arteriosclerosis, thromboembolism, and hereditary conditions like CADASIL. It outlines major risk factors such as hypertension, smoking, hypercholesterolemia, heart disease, and diabetes mellitus. The text describes the pathophysiology involving reduced blood flow leading to secondary inflammation, discusses the demographic patterns affecting individuals over 50 years of age equally across genders, and explains the diagnostic approach using clinical evaluation combined with neuroimaging techniques including MRI and CT scanning to identify white matter degeneration and subcortical infarcts.",
