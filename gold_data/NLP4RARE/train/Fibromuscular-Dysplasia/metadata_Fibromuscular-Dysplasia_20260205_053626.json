  "title": "Fibromuscular Dysplasia (FMD): Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approaches",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing fibromuscular dysplasia, a vascular disease causing abnormal artery wall development leading to stenosis, aneurysms, or dissections.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), a vascular disorder characterized by abnormal cell development in artery walls. The document details how FMD can cause arterial narrowing (stenosis), aneurysms, or tears (dissections), most commonly affecting renal arteries and carotid/vertebral arteries supplying the brain. It discusses the disease's demographic patterns, noting its predominance in women, its presentation in pediatric populations, and associations with conditions like Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type IV. The document also covers diagnostic approaches including various imaging modalities such as duplex ultrasound, CT angiography, MRI, and arteriography procedures, providing healthcare professionals with essential information for recognizing and diagnosing this rare vascular condition.",
