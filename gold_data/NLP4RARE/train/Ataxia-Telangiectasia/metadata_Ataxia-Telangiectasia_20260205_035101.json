  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of ataxia telangiectasia (AT), a complex genetic neurodegenerative disorder that typically manifests in early childhood. The condition is characterized by three primary features: progressive ataxia (impaired coordination of voluntary movements), telangiectasia (reddish skin and mucous membrane lesions caused by dilated blood vessels), and immunodeficiency affecting both cellular and humoral immune responses. The document details how AT patients experience increased susceptibility to respiratory infections and have elevated risks for developing malignancies, particularly lymphomas, leukemia, and brain tumors. It notes the typical age of onset between one to three years, familial clustering patterns, equal gender distribution, and prevalence estimates of 1 in 40,000-100,000 live births in the United States.",
