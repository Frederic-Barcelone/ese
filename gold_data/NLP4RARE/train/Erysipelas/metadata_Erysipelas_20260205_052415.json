  "title": "Erysipelas: Superficial Skin Infection Clinical Overview",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing erysipelas, a superficial skin infection primarily caused by group A streptococcal bacteria, characterized by a distinctive fiery red rash with raised edges.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of erysipelas, a superficial skin infection affecting the upper layers of the skin. The document details the primary causative agent (Streptococcus pyogenes and other group A streptococci), characteristic clinical presentation including the distinctive fiery red rash with raised edges, and epidemiological patterns. It notes the changing distribution of the infection from historically affecting the face to now predominantly involving the legs in approximately 80% of cases. The document also covers the demographic groups most commonly affected, including infants, young children, and elderly adults aged 60-80, and emphasizes the diagnostic value of the characteristic lesion appearance.",
