  "short_description": "Clinical overview of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) demographics, including age, gender, ethnicity patterns and incidence rates.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive epidemiological overview of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common familial form of leukemia. It details key demographic characteristics including the 2:1 male predominance, average onset age of 72 years, and higher prevalence among white populations, particularly those of Russian and Eastern European Jewish ancestry. The document emphasizes that CLL rarely affects children or individuals under 30, with incidence rates increasing with age. Current U.S. estimates suggest an incidence of 3 per 100,000 people, though this may represent an undercount of actual cases.",
