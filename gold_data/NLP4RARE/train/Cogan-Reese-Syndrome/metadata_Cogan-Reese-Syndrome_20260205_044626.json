  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Cogan-Reese syndrome, an extremely rare ophthalmological condition characterized by distinctive iris abnormalities including a matted or smudged iris surface appearance, nodular iris nevi development, peripheral anterior synechiae formation, and secondary glaucoma that may result in vision loss. The document details the demographic patterns of this disorder, noting its predominant occurrence in young to middle-aged white females with a unilateral presentation and slow progression over time. It also addresses the epidemiological aspects, including gender ratios and familial occurrence patterns, making it a valuable reference for healthcare professionals dealing with rare iris disorders.",
