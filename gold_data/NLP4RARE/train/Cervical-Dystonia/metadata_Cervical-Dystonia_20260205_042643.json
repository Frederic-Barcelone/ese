  "title": "Cervical Dystonia: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Guidelines",
  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical guide covering cervical dystonia (spasmodic torticollis), a rare neurological disorder characterized by involuntary neck muscle contractions causing abnormal head and neck movements.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a detailed overview of cervical dystonia, also known as spasmodic torticollis, which is identified as the most common form of focal dystonia in office settings. The document covers the disorder's clinical presentation, including involuntary muscle contractions that cause abnormal neck and head postures, its demographic patterns (affecting women twice as often as men, typically onset between ages 40-60), and its significant impact on quality of life and daily activities. The text addresses the unknown etiology while noting potential genetic susceptibility, discusses the estimated prevalence of 60,000 cases in the United States, and outlines diagnostic approaches that rely primarily on clinical examination and patient history rather than laboratory or imaging tests. The document serves as a clinical reference for healthcare providers managing this neurological condition.",
