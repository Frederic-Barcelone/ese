  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of Aplasia Cutis Congenita, a rare congenital disorder affecting both males and females equally. The document describes the condition's key characteristics, including the absence of certain skin layers present at birth, most commonly affecting the scalp but also potentially involving the trunk, arms, and legs. It explains that affected areas are typically covered by a thin, transparent membrane, and may involve visible skull or abnormally developed underlying structures. The document notes the disorder's complicated inheritance pattern and mentions that it can occur as a primary condition or in association with other underlying disorders, with at least 500 cases documented in medical literature.",
