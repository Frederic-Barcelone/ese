  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type IV (HSAN IV), a rare genetic disorder that affects sensory and autonomic nerve function. The document details the equal gender distribution of the condition, notes that several hundred cases have been documented in medical literature, and highlights the higher prevalence in Japanese and Israeli-Bedouin populations due to founder effects. It explains how isolated populations can lead to increased frequency of specific genetic traits and confirms that the disorder manifests from birth, providing essential background information for understanding the demographic and genetic patterns of this rare neuropathy.",
