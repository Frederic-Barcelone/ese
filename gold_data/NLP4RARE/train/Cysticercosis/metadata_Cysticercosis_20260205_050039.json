  "short_description": "Clinical document describing cysticercosis, a rare infectious disease caused by Taenia solium larval cysts affecting various body tissues including the brain.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of cysticercosis, an infectious disease caused by larval cysts of the pork tapeworm Taenia solium. The document covers the pathophysiology of the condition, including how cysts can affect multiple organ systems with particular emphasis on neurocysticercosis when the brain is involved. It details clinical manifestations ranging from seizures and headaches to effects on the eyes, spinal cord, skin, and heart. The document also addresses epidemiological aspects, noting equal gender distribution with some variant-specific exceptions, geographic prevalence patterns, and increasing incidence in the United States due to immigration from endemic regions. Additionally, it discusses transmission mechanisms through consumption of undercooked pork and outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, and specialized imaging techniques such as MRI and CT scanning for neurocysticercosis diagnosis.",
