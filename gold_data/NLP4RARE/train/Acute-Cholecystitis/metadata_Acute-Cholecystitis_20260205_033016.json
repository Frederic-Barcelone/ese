  "long_description": "This clinical educational document provides a comprehensive overview of acute cholecystitis, beginning with normal gallbladder anatomy and function in bile storage and fat digestion. It explains the pathophysiology of gallstone formation from bile components like cholesterol and bilirubin, and describes how gallstone obstruction in bile ducts leads to gallbladder distension, biliary colic, and progression to acute calculous cholecystitis (ACC). The document also covers the inflammatory cascade involving infection and ischemia, and discusses the potential progression to chronic cholecystitis with associated structural changes to the gallbladder wall.",
