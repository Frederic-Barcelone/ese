  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of acquired autoimmune hemolytic anemia, a rare hematological disorder characterized by premature destruction of red blood cells due to autoimmune mechanisms. The document explains the pathophysiology of the condition, noting that it occurs when the body's immune system mistakenly attacks healthy red blood cells, reducing their normal 120-day lifespan. It details the epidemiological patterns, including the higher prevalence in women under 50 for idiopathic cases, and describes the two main subtypes: cold antibody hemolytic anemia (affecting elderly patients) and warm antibody hemolytic anemia (affecting all age groups). The document also outlines diagnostic approaches, including blood tests to assess the ratio of immature to mature red blood cells and the Coombs test to detect elevated antibody levels, providing essential information for healthcare professionals managing this complex autoimmune condition.",
