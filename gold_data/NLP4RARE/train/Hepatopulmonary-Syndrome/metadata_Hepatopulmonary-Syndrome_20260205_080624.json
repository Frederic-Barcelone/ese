  "short_description": "Clinical document distinguishing hepatopulmonary syndrome from portopulmonary hypertension as distinct vascular complications of liver disease.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a clear differentiation between hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS) and portopulmonary hypertension, two commonly confused vascular complications that arise from liver disease. The document explains that while both conditions affect the pulmonary vasculature in patients with liver disease, they have opposite pathophysiological mechanisms: HPS is characterized by vasodilatation leading to hypoxemia, whereas portopulmonary hypertension involves vasoconstriction and obstruction of blood vessels resulting in pulmonary arterial hypertension. This distinction is crucial for proper diagnosis and treatment planning in patients with liver disease.",
