  "title": "Giant Cell Myocarditis: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approach",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing giant cell myocarditis, a rare idiopathic cardiovascular disorder characterized by heart muscle inflammation and giant cell infiltration.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of giant cell myocarditis, a rare and serious cardiovascular condition of unknown etiology. The document details the pathophysiology involving widespread infiltration of giant cells (formed by macrophage fusion) and associated inflammatory cells that cause myocardial destruction. It covers the clinical presentation including abnormal heartbeats, chest pain, and progressive heart failure, often necessitating heart transplantation. The document emphasizes the demographic characteristics, noting equal gender distribution and predominant occurrence in young to middle-aged adults with a median age of 42 years. Diagnostic approaches are outlined, highlighting the necessity of heart tissue biopsy for definitive diagnosis and additional cardiac assessments including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization to exclude other cardiac pathologies.",
