This is one of five enzymes that play a role in the breakdown and removal of nitrogen from the body, a process known as the urea cycle. The lack of the CPSI enzyme results in excessive accumulation of nitrogen, in the form of ammonia (hyperammonemia), in the blood. Affected children may experience vomiting, refusal to eat, progressive lethargy, and coma. CPSID is inherited as an autosomal",
