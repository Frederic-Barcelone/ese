  "short_description": "A rare inherited disorder characterized by complete or partial lack of the carbamoyl phosphate synthetase enzyme, leading to hyperammonemia and potentially life-threatening symptoms.",
  "long_description": "This document provides an overview of Carbamoyl Phosphate Synthetase I Deficiency (CPSID), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting the urea cycle. The condition results from deficiency of the CPS enzyme, one of five enzymes responsible for nitrogen breakdown and removal from the body. The enzyme deficiency leads to excessive accumulation of ammonia in the blood (hyperammonemia), causing symptoms such as vomiting, feeding difficulties, progressive lethargy, and potentially coma in affected children. With an estimated frequency of 1 in 150-200,000 births, CPSID represents a significant portion of urea cycle disorders, though these conditions are often under-diagnosed due to lack of recognition.",
