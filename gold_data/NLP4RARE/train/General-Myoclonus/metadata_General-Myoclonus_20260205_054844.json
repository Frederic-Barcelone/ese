  "short_description": "Clinical document providing an overview of myoclonus, describing involuntary muscle jerking caused by contractions or relaxation, its symptoms, and epidemiological data.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of myoclonus, a neurological condition characterized by sudden, involuntary jerking movements of muscles or muscle groups. The document explains the distinction between positive myoclonus (caused by muscle contractions) and negative myoclonus (caused by muscle relaxation), emphasizing that these movements are uncontrollable by the affected individual. It discusses the variable frequency of myoclonic jerks, their potential triggers, and the spectrum of severity from mild occasional episodes in healthy individuals to severe cases that significantly impair daily activities like eating and talking. The document also presents important epidemiological data, noting equal gender distribution and providing specific incidence and prevalence rates in the general population.",
