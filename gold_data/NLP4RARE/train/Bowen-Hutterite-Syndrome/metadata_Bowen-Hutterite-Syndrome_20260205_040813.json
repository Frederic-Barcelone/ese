  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Bowen Hutterite syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by growth delays, craniofacial malformations, and other physical abnormalities primarily affecting the Hutterite population.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Bowen Hutterite syndrome, a rare congenital genetic disorder first described in 1976. The syndrome is characterized by intrauterine growth retardation, failure to thrive in infancy, distinctive craniofacial malformations, and various physical abnormalities including joint restrictions, finger deformities, foot malformations, and cryptorchidism in males. Some patients may also present with kidney, brain, and other organ malformations. The disorder follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and affects males and females equally. With over 20 cases reported in medical literature since its initial description, the syndrome predominantly affects members of the Hutterite religious community, an Anabaptist sect living in communal settlements across Montana, North and South Dakota, and Alberta, Canada.",
