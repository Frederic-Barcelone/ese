  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Canavan disease, a rare genetic neurological disorder causing spongy degeneration of brain white matter, primarily affecting infants and children.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Canavan disease, a rare autosomal recessive genetic neurological disorder characterized by spongy degeneration of white matter in the brain. The text details the clinical presentation, including early symptoms that typically manifest between 3-6 months of age such as macrocephaly, hypotonia, developmental delays, and lack of head control. The document explains the genetic basis involving mutations in the ASPA gene affecting N-acetylaspartic acid metabolism, discusses the inheritance pattern, and provides epidemiological data showing higher prevalence in Ashkenazi Jewish populations with carrier frequencies of 1 in 40-58 individuals. The prognosis indicates most affected children develop life-threatening complications by age 10, making this a critical reference for understanding this devastating pediatric neurological condition.",
