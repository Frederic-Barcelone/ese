  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about factor X deficiency, a rare inherited bleeding disorder that affects both men and women across all ethnic and racial groups. The text discusses the estimated prevalence of the condition in the general population, noting that it occurs in approximately 1 in every 500,000 to 1,000,000 individuals. The document highlights the challenges in accurately determining the true frequency of this rare disorder, as cases often go unrecognized or are misdiagnosed due to the rarity of the condition and potential lack of awareness among healthcare providers.",
