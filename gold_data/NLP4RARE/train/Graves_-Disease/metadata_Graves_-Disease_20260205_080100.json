  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Graves' disease, focusing on its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic methodology. It details the demographic patterns of the condition, including its predominance in females (5-10:1 ratio), peak incidence in middle age (40-60 years), and global prevalence of 2-3% in the general population. The document explains that Graves' disease is the leading cause of hyperthyroidism and outlines the diagnostic process, which involves patient history, clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings, and specialized laboratory tests including thyroid hormone levels, thyroid-stimulating hormone measurements, and specific antibody detection for confirmation.",
