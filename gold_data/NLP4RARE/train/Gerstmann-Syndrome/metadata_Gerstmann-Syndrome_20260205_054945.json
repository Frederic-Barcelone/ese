  "title": "Gerstmann Syndrome: A Rare Neurological Disorder",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Gerstmann syndrome, a rare neurological disorder characterized by four core cognitive deficits including agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, and left-right disorientation.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Gerstmann syndrome, a rare neurological condition first identified by Dr. Josef Gerstmann in 1924. The syndrome can manifest as either an acquired brain injury or a developmental disorder, affecting males and females equally. It is characterized by a specific tetrad of cognitive impairments: agraphia (inability to express thoughts in writing), acalculia (difficulty with arithmetic), finger agnosia (inability to recognize fingers), and left-right disorientation. The document discusses diagnostic criteria, typical presentation in children versus adults, and associated symptoms such as constructional apraxia. It emphasizes that while the exact incidence is unknown, the condition is typically recognized in school-age children who experience difficulties with mathematics and writing tasks.",
