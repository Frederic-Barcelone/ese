  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Fountain syndrome, an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, facial edema, skeletal abnormalities, and hearing loss.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Fountain syndrome, an exceptionally rare genetic multisystem disorder with only several documented cases in medical literature. The condition presents with a distinctive constellation of symptoms including intellectual disability, characteristic facial swelling (edema) affecting the cheeks and lips due to subcutaneous fluid accumulation, various skeletal abnormalities, and sensorineural hearing loss caused by cochlear malformations. The syndrome follows an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern and affects both males and females equally. Due to its rarity and potential for misdiagnosis, the true prevalence remains unknown, highlighting the challenges in diagnosing and understanding ultra-rare genetic conditions.",
