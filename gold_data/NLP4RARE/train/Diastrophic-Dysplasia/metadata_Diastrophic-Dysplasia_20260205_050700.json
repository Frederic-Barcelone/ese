  "short_description": "Clinical document describing diastrophic dysplasia, a rare congenital disorder characterized by short-limbed dwarfism and skeletal abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of diastrophic dysplasia (also known as diastrophic dwarfism), a rare congenital disorder with variable presentation. The document details the characteristic features including short stature with disproportionately short limbs, skeletal and joint dysplasia affecting multiple body systems, progressive spinal curvature abnormalities such as scoliosis and kyphosis, distinctive ear abnormalities affecting the pinnae, and potential craniofacial malformations. The text emphasizes the wide variability in symptom severity and presentation among affected individuals, making this a valuable reference for understanding the clinical spectrum of this rare genetic condition.",
