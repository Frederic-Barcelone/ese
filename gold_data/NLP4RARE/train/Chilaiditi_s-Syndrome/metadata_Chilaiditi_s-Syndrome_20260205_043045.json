  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Chilaiditi's syndrome, a rare anatomical condition first described in 1910 by Greek radiologist Demetrius Chilaiditi. The document details the pathophysiology of colonic interposition between the liver and diaphragm, clinical presentation including abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and potential bowel obstruction, and diagnostic approaches using various imaging modalities. It covers epidemiological data showing equal gender distribution, higher prevalence in older adults, and estimated population incidence of 0.025-0.28%. The document serves as a clinical reference for healthcare professionals encountering this uncommon but clinically significant condition.",
