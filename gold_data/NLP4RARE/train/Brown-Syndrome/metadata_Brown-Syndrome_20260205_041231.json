  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Brown Syndrome, a rare ophthalmological condition that affects eye movement capabilities. The disorder can be either congenital (present at birth) or acquired, and is characterized by abnormalities in the superior oblique tendon sheath, including shortening, thickening, or inflammation. These abnormalities result in restricted upward eye movement and various associated symptoms including limited adduction/abduction, eye misalignment, ptosis, strabismus, and compensatory head positioning. The document details the clinical presentation, prevalence patterns showing slight female predominance, and notes that while typically unilateral, bilateral involvement occurs in approximately 10% of cases.",
