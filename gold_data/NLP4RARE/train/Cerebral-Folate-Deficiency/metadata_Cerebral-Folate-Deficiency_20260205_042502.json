  "short_description": "A clinical document discussing the rare occurrence of cerebral folate deficiency, with fewer than 20 documented cases in scientific literature.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document examines cerebral folate deficiency, an extremely rare neurological condition with limited documented cases in the medical literature. The document highlights the scarcity of reported cases, noting that fewer than 20 individuals have been documented in scientific publications, and acknowledges that the exact prevalence of this condition remains unknown. This information is valuable for understanding the rarity of the disorder and the challenges in establishing comprehensive epidemiological data for such uncommon neurological conditions.",
