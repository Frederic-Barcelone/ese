  "short_description": "Clinical document describing diagnostic approaches for biotinidase deficiency, including newborn screening, blood testing, and prenatal testing options.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides comprehensive information about the diagnostic methods available for biotinidase deficiency (BTD). It covers newborn screening procedures as the primary detection method, explains the confirmatory testing process through blood biotinidase activity measurement, and describes genetic testing options for identifying specific mutations. The document also details prenatal diagnostic options including chorionic villi sampling and amniocentesis, which can be performed as early as 12 weeks of pregnancy. This information is essential for healthcare providers involved in screening, diagnosing, and managing biotinidase deficiency in patients.",
