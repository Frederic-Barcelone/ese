  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides an overview of ATR-X syndrome, a genetic disorder that predominantly affects males. The document discusses the epidemiology of the condition, noting that while more than 200 cases have been documented through molecular genetic testing laboratories, the true prevalence in the general population remains unclear due to underdiagnosis. The text also addresses the genetic inheritance pattern, specifically noting that female carriers of the mutated gene typically do not develop clinical manifestations of the disorder. This information is relevant for healthcare providers, genetic counselors, and researchers working with X-linked genetic conditions.",
