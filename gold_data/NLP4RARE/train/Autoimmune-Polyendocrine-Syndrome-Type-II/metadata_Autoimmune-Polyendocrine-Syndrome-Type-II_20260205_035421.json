  "short_description": "Clinical overview of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II, a rare disorder causing multiple endocrine gland failures through autoimmune mechanisms.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome type II (AIPS-II), also known as Schmidt syndrome. It describes this rare autoimmune disorder characterized by the progressive failure of multiple endocrine glands, including the adrenals (Addison's disease), thyroid (Hashimoto's thyroiditis), gonads, pancreas, and sometimes parathyroid glands. The document covers the evolution of understanding of this condition, its diverse clinical presentations due to variable gland involvement, associated malnutrition from intestinal absorption issues, epidemiological data showing a prevalence of 14-20 cases per million with a 3-4 times higher incidence in females, typical onset in the third or fourth decade of life, and current treatment approaches focusing on individual hormone replacement therapy for each affected gland.",
