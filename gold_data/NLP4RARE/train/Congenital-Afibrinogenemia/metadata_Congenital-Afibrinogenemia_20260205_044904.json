  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about congenital afibrinogenemia, an extremely rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder with an incidence of approximately one in a million individuals. The content discusses the epidemiological characteristics of the condition, noting equal prevalence between males and females with no apparent ethnic predisposition. The document emphasizes the increased risk in consanguineous populations, particularly in regions with high rates of consanguineous marriage such as the Middle East and Southern India, where children of blood-related parents have higher likelihood of inheriting the rare mutations from both parents required for disease manifestation.",
