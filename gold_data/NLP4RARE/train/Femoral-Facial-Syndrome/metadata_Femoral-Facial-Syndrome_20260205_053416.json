  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of Femoral-Facial Syndrome, a rare disorder that primarily occurs sporadically in the population with occasional autosomal dominant inheritance patterns. The document outlines the key clinical manifestations including underdeveloped femurs and unusual facial characteristics, notes the male predominance of the condition, and provides epidemiological data indicating approximately 55 reported cases as of 1993. The document also highlights the significant association with maternal diabetes, which is present in one-third of cases, providing important context for understanding potential risk factors and clinical presentation patterns.",
