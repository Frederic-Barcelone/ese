  "short_description": "Clinical document providing an overview of cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a common viral infection from the herpes virus family that often remains asymptomatic.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides essential information about cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection, a viral condition caused by human cytomegalovirus from the herpes virus family. The document explains that CMV rarely causes obvious illness and can remain dormant before reactivation, similar to other herpes viruses. It highlights the epidemiology showing that half of all adults in the United States are infected by age 30, with children being primarily affected. The document also covers transmission routes, including mother-to-child transmission through the umbilical cord during pregnancy, and notes the relationship between CMV and other herpes group viruses.",
