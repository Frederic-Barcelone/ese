  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Chandler's syndrome, a rare eye disorder characterized by corneal endothelial proliferation, corneal edema, iris distortion, and glaucoma.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Chandler's syndrome (CS), a rare ophthalmological condition that represents the most common variant of iridocorneal endothelial (ICE) syndrome. The text describes the pathophysiology involving endothelial cell proliferation leading to corneal edema, iris distortion, and elevated intraocular pressure. It details the epidemiological characteristics, noting the condition's predominance in women during early to middle adulthood, its unilateral presentation, and its occurrence across different ethnic groups. The document positions Chandler's syndrome within the broader spectrum of ICE syndrome alongside progressive iris atrophy and Cogan-Reese syndrome.",
