  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome, a rare pediatric skin condition characterized by blisters following viral infections in children aged 9 months to 9 years.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Gianotti-Crosti Syndrome, a self-limiting dermatological condition that primarily affects children between 9 months and 9 years of age. The document details the characteristic presentation of flat-topped, fluid-filled blisters that typically appear on the face, buttocks, arms, and legs following viral infections such as Coxsackievirus, Hepatitis-B, Infectious Mononucleosis, or Cytomegalovirus. It explains the geographical variations in causative agents, with Hepatitis-B being more common in other countries while other viruses predominate in North America. The document covers clinical manifestations including potential lymphadenopathy and hepatomegaly, typical duration of symptoms (15-60 days for skin lesions), and management approaches focusing on symptomatic and supportive care including topical treatments for pruritus.",
