  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about frontofacionasal dysplasia, an extremely rare genetic disorder that was first described by T.R. Gollop in 1981. The condition was initially identified in two Brazilian siblings and has since been documented in fewer than 10 cases worldwide. The document appears to focus on the epidemiological aspects of this rare craniofacial malformation syndrome, highlighting its limited occurrence and potential genetic basis within specific populations, particularly those of Brazilian descent.",
