  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Ellis-Van Creveld syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting approximately 150 individuals worldwide. The syndrome is characterized by distinctive features including short limb dwarfism, polydactyly (extra fingers and/or toes), abnormal fingernail development, and congenital heart defects in over half of cases. The document details the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, diagnostic criteria including skeletal abnormalities and growth patterns, and notes higher prevalence in specific populations such as the Old Order Amish community in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. It also covers genetic testing availability and prenatal diagnostic options through ultrasound screening.",
