  "title": "Cutis Laxa: Rare Connective Tissue Disorder - Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approaches",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of cutis laxa, a rare connective tissue disorder affecting elastic fibers, including epidemiology, diagnostic methods, and genetic testing approaches.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of cutis laxa, a rare genetic disorder characterized by loose, sagging skin due to defective elastic fibers. The text covers the epidemiological aspects of the condition, noting its occurrence in approximately 400 families worldwide with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 1,000,000 individuals, affecting all races and ethnic groups equally. The document details diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, specialized testing, and skin biopsy procedures that reveal characteristic elastic fiber changes. It also discusses the challenges in distinguishing between different genetic subtypes and emphasizes the role of molecular genetic testing in confirming inherited forms of cutis laxa, though such testing is only available at specialized laboratories.",
