  "title": "Dracunculosis: Guinea Worm Disease Clinical Overview",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing dracunculosis, a parasitic infection caused by Dracunculus medinensis (guinea worm), including symptoms, transmission, and epidemiology.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of dracunculosis, also known as guinea worm disease, caused by the parasitic worm Dracunculus medinensis. The document details the infection pathway from contaminated water consumption through water fleas to larval development and maturation under the skin, resulting in characteristic chronic skin ulcers. It describes the clinical presentation including papules, blisters, and painful ulcers, typically affecting the legs. The document also covers the disease's epidemiology, noting the dramatic reduction in global cases from 3.2 million in 1986 to fewer than 100,000 currently, with remaining cases concentrated in Sudan and West African countries. Diagnostic criteria based on characteristic symptoms and worm emergence are also outlined.",
