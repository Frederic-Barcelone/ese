  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Ablepharon-Macrostomia Syndrome (AMS), an extremely rare congenital genetic disorder first described in 1977. The syndrome is characterized by multiple physical abnormalities including craniofacial malformations, skin abnormalities, finger deformities, and genital malformations. Additional features may include nipple and abdominal wall malformations. The document discusses the developmental implications of AMS, including potential language delays and intellectual disabilities in affected children. It also covers the historical context of the syndrome's discovery and the limited number of cases reported in medical literature, including both isolated cases and familial occurrences.",
