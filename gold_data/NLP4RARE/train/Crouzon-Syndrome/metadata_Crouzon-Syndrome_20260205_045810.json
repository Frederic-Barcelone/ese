  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on Crouzon syndrome, a form of craniosynostosis. The document presents population statistics showing the condition affects approximately 1.6 in 100,000 people, with some medical literature suggesting a higher prevalence in males compared to females. The document also contextualizes Crouzon syndrome within the broader category of craniosynostosis conditions, which collectively affect about 1 in 2,000-2,500 live births. This information is valuable for understanding the demographic patterns and population burden of this genetic cranial disorder.",
