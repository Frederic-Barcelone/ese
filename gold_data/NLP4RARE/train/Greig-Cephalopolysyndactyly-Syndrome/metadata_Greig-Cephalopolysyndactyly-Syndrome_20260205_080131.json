  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides information about Greig Cephalopolysyndactyly Syndrome (GCPS), focusing on its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic considerations. The document notes that GCPS affects males and females equally, with over 200 cases reported in medical literature. It highlights a key diagnostic challenge: because some affected individuals may present with mild or few symptoms, they may remain undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true prevalence of GCPS in the general population. This underscores the importance of clinical awareness and proper diagnostic criteria for this rare genetic condition.",
