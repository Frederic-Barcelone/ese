  "short_description": "Clinical overview of aspartylglycosaminuria, a rare genetic lysosomal storage disease primarily affecting individuals of Finnish descent, characterized by progressive developmental abnormalities and metabolic dysfunction.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of aspartylglycosaminuria, a very rare genetic disorder classified as a lysosomal storage disease and inborn error of metabolism. The condition is most prevalent among individuals of Finnish descent but occurs rarely in other populations worldwide. The document details the progressive nature of the disease, beginning with normal development in early infancy followed by the emergence of symptoms including recurrent diarrhea and infections, coarse facial features, skeletal deformities, ocular abnormalities, and progressive mental deterioration. The text covers the full spectrum of clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and current treatment approaches, which remain primarily symptomatic and supportive, emphasizing the importance of genetic counseling for affected families.",
