  "short_description": "Clinical document describing congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF), a rare liver disease present at birth that is typically associated with kidney ciliopathies and hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of congenital hepatic fibrosis (CHF), a rare congenital liver disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1/10,000-20,000. The document details the pathophysiology of CHF, including its characteristic features of hepatomegaly, portal hypertension, and hepatic fibrosis. It emphasizes the strong association between CHF and ciliopathies affecting the kidneys, particularly hepatorenal fibrocystic diseases such as polycystic kidney disease and nephronophthisis. The text covers clinical manifestations including gastrointestinal bleeding, splenomegaly, and hypersplenism, as well as diagnostic approaches using ultrasound, MRI, and occasionally liver biopsy. The document also discusses the relationship between CHF and Caroli's syndrome, and outlines the comprehensive evaluation process including family history assessment, physical examination, and various diagnostic tests to identify underlying fibrocystic disease syndromes.",
