  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Chiari-Frommel Syndrome, a rare postpartum endocrine disorder characterized by persistent galactorrhea, amenorrhea, and anovulation lasting more than six months after childbirth.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Chiari-Frommel Syndrome, a rare endocrine disorder affecting postpartum women. The syndrome is characterized by three primary symptoms that persist for more than six months after delivery: abnormal breast milk production (galactorrhea), absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea), and lack of ovulation (anovulation). The document details the clinical presentation, including associated symptoms such as emotional distress, headaches, vision problems, and potential uterine atrophy. It emphasizes that these symptoms occur even when the mother is not breastfeeding and that the preceding pregnancy and delivery are typically normal. The text also notes that some cases may resolve spontaneously without treatment, with hormonal cycles and reproductive function returning to normal.",
