  "short_description": "Clinical overview of idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery, a rare benign congenital defect characterized by abnormal widening of the main pulmonary artery without apparent cause.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of idiopathic dilatation of the pulmonary artery (IDPA), a rare congenital cardiovascular anomaly. The text describes the condition's characteristics, including the abnormal widening of the main pulmonary artery without identifiable anatomical or physiological causes. It details the typically asymptomatic nature of IDPA, minimal clinical signs such as pulmonary ejection sounds and soft systolic murmurs, and diagnostic approaches using chest X-rays and electrocardiograms. The document discusses potential etiological theories involving elastic tissue development defects and associations with connective tissue disorders like Marfan syndrome and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. It emphasizes the benign nature of the condition, noting that no treatment is required and patients maintain normal life expectancy in the absence of other cardiac lesions.",
