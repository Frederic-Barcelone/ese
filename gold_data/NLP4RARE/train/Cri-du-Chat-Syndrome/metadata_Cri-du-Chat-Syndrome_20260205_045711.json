  "long_description": "This clinical research document examines the epidemiological characteristics of cri du chat syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The document provides key statistical information about the condition's prevalence, noting that it affects females more frequently than males and occurs in approximately 1 in 15,000 to 50,000 live births. The text also addresses important diagnostic considerations, specifically highlighting that some cases may remain undiagnosed, which creates challenges in accurately determining the true frequency of this chromosomal disorder in the general population. This information is valuable for healthcare professionals and researchers working in genetics and rare disease diagnosis.",
