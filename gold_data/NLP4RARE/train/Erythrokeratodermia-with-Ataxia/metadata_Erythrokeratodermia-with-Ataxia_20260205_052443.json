  "short_description": "Clinical overview of erythrokeratodermia with ataxia, a rare hereditary disorder characterized by childhood skin plaques followed by adult-onset neurological symptoms including ataxia and dysarthria.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of erythrokeratodermia with ataxia (EKDA), an extremely rare hereditary neurocutaneous syndrome that affects both the skin and nervous system. The disorder presents with a distinctive biphasic pattern: red, hardened scaly skin plaques (ichthyosis) that develop during infancy and childhood, particularly on the extremities, which typically disappear during young adulthood. After a dormant period, progressive neurological symptoms emerge around age 40, including impaired muscle coordination (ataxia), speech difficulties (dysarthria), involuntary eye movements (nystagmus), and decreased tendon reflexes. The document outlines the clinical presentation, progression, and diagnostic considerations for this rare condition that affects males and females equally.",
