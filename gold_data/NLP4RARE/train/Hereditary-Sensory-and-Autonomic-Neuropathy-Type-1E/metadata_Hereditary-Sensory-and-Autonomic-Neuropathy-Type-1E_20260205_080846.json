  "long_description": "This clinical research document examines Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type 1E (HSAN1E), a complex genetic disorder linked to DNMT1 gene mutations. The document highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with this rare condition, noting that it affects both males and females equally but is often misdiagnosed or remains undiagnosed due to limited clinical awareness and the complexity of the disease presentation. This diagnostic difficulty significantly impacts the ability to accurately determine the prevalence and incidence rates of HSAN1E in the general population, underscoring the need for improved recognition and understanding of this hereditary neuropathy.",
