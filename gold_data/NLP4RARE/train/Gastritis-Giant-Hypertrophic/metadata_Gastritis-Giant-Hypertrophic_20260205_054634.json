  "short_description": "Clinical document describing giant hypertrophic gastritis, a stomach inflammation condition characterized by abnormally large gastric folds resembling polyps.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Giant Hypertrophic Gastritis (GHG), a general term for stomach inflammation caused by inflammatory cell accumulation in the gastric mucosa. The condition is characterized by the formation of abnormally large, coiled ridges or folds in the stomach's inner wall that resemble polyps. The document explains that GHG encompasses a collection of related disorders with variable symptoms, unknown exact etiology, and equal gender distribution. It notes that while the condition can affect both children and adults, it occurs more frequently in late adulthood, making it an important consideration for gastroenterologists and clinicians treating patients with gastric symptoms.",
