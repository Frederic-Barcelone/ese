  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Aicardi syndrome, a rare genetic disorder primarily affecting females, characterized by infantile spasms, brain malformations, and distinctive eye abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Aicardi syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that typically manifests between four months and four years of age with involuntary muscle spasms. The syndrome predominantly affects females and is characterized by a constellation of symptoms including epilepsy, intellectual disability, hypotonia, microcephaly, microphthalmia, retinal colobomas, and skeletal abnormalities. The document outlines the significant developmental delays associated with the condition and notes its potential life-threatening complications from respiratory infections. Diagnostic approaches are detailed, including MRI brain imaging to assess corpus callosum development, EEG monitoring for seizure activity, and ophthalmological examination to identify characteristic retinal lacunae. With an estimated 300-500 cases worldwide, this rare condition requires multidisciplinary medical management and careful monitoring throughout childhood.",
