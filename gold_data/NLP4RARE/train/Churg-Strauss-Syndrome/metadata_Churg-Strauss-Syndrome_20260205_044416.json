  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare multi-organ disorder characterized by hypereosinophilia, vasculitis, and granulomatosis, often preceded by asthma.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Churg-Strauss syndrome, a rare systemic disorder that primarily affects the lungs and other organ systems. The document details the pathophysiology involving abnormal clustering of white blood cells (hypereosinophilia), blood vessel inflammation (vasculitis), and inflammatory nodular lesions (granulomas). It emphasizes the strong association with allergic history and asthma, which typically precedes systemic manifestations by months to decades. The document includes epidemiological data showing equal gender distribution with slight male predominance, peak incidence between ages 30-50, and an estimated annual incidence of 2.4 per million individuals. The content serves as an educational resource for healthcare professionals to understand the clinical presentation, demographics, and diagnostic challenges of this potentially underdiagnosed condition.",
