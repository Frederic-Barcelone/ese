The document covers the disorder's key characteristics, including feelings of detachment and being an outside observer of one's own mental processes or body. It discusses potential triggers such as traumatic events, demographic patterns showing higher prevalence in women and individuals aged 15-30, and diagnostic approaches requiring comprehensive physical and psychiatric evaluations to rule out other medical conditions or substance-related causes.",
