  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of blastomycosis, a rare infectious disease caused by the fungus Blastomyces dermatitidis. The content describes the pathophysiology of the infection, including how the fungus is inhaled as mold spores, converts to yeast form in the body, and spreads through the bloodstream. The document outlines the variable clinical presentation depending on affected organ systems, with characteristic symptoms including fever, chills, cough, and dyspnea. It details the chronic phase manifestations primarily affecting lungs and skin, with potential involvement of genitourinary tract and bones. The document also identifies immunocompromised individuals as the primary at-risk population for this systemic mycosis.",
