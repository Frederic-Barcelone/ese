  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Branchiootorenal/Branchiootic Spectrum (BOR/BOS) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 40,000 individuals. The syndrome demonstrates no gender preference, affecting males and females equally. Notably, BOR/BOS syndrome accounts for 2-3% of cases in children with profound deafness, highlighting its significance in pediatric hearing loss. The document appears to focus on the prevalence and demographic characteristics of this multisystem disorder that typically involves abnormalities of the ears, kidneys, and branchial arch derivatives.",
