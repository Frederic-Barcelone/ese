  "title": "Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency (AVED): Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Criteria",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing AVED, a rare inherited neurodegenerative disorder characterized by movement coordination impairment and peripheral neuropathy.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Ataxia with Vitamin E Deficiency (AVED), a rare autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorder affecting fewer than 1 in 1 million people globally. The document details the progressive, multisystem nature of AVED, including its primary neurological manifestations of ataxia and peripheral neuropathy, as well as associated complications such as eye abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, and scoliosis. It discusses the clinical similarities to Friedreich's ataxia, epidemiological data including higher prevalence in Tunisia, variable age of onset from childhood to adulthood, and diagnostic criteria based on clinical evaluation and laboratory findings including low vitamin E levels with normal lipoproteins and lipids.",
