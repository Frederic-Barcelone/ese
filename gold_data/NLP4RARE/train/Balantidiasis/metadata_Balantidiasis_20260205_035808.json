  "title": "Balantidiasis: Rare Intestinal Infection Caused by Balantidium coli",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of balantidiasis, a rare intestinal infection caused by the protozoan parasite Balantidium coli that primarily affects pigs but can occasionally infect humans.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of balantidiasis, a rare infectious disease caused by the single-celled parasite Balantidium coli. The text details the spectrum of clinical presentations, ranging from asymptomatic cases to severe manifestations including bloody diarrhea, intestinal ulceration, and potentially life-threatening complications such as intestinal perforation and peritonitis. The document explains transmission routes through contact with pig feces or contaminated water, identifies risk factors including poor nutrition and compromised immune systems, and notes the geographic distribution of the disease in tropical regions. This appears to be educational material for healthcare professionals or students studying parasitic infections and tropical medicine.",
