  "short_description": "Clinical document describing formaldehyde poisoning symptoms, causes, and exposure risks in occupational and medical settings.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of formaldehyde poisoning, a disorder caused by inhalation of formaldehyde fumes or direct exposure to the chemical. The document details the varied symptoms ranging from mild irritation of eyes, nose, and throat to severe complications including hemolysis in dialysis patients, cardiovascular abnormalities, and potential coma. It outlines multiple exposure pathways including occupational exposure in manufacturing, construction materials like chipboard and foam insulation, accidental ingestion, and medical equipment contamination. The document emphasizes the importance of proper safety protocols, particularly in healthcare settings where formaldehyde-based cleaning agents are used for dialysis machines and other medical equipment.",
