  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Coffin-Lowry syndrome, a rare X-linked genetic disorder characterized by intellectual disability, distinctive facial features, and skeletal abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Coffin-Lowry syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the RSK2 gene. The document details the characteristic clinical manifestations including intellectual disability, distinctive craniofacial features such as maxillary hypoplasia and hypertelorism, hand abnormalities with tapered fingers, short stature, and various skeletal deformities including kyphoscoliosis and pectus carinatum. The text explains the X-linked dominant inheritance pattern and notes that while the condition affects both males and females equally, males typically experience more severe symptoms. This appears to be educational material for healthcare professionals or researchers working with rare genetic disorders.",
