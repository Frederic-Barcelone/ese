  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Felty syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder characterized by rheumatoid arthritis, splenomegaly, and neutropenia.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Felty syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that affects 1-3% of rheumatoid arthritis patients. The document details the classic diagnostic triad of rheumatoid arthritis, enlarged spleen (splenomegaly), and low white blood cell count (neutropenia), along with associated symptoms including fatigue, fever, weight loss, and skin pigmentation changes. It covers epidemiological data showing the condition is three times more common in women than men, typically affects individuals aged 50-70, and is less frequent in African populations compared to Caucasians. The document also addresses the unknown etiology, suspected autoimmune pathogenesis with possible genetic transmission, differential diagnoses, and diagnostic approaches through clinical evaluation and identification of the characteristic triad of findings.",
