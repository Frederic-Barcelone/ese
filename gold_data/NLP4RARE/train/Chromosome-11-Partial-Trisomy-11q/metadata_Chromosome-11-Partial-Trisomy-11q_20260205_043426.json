  "title": "Chromosome 11, Partial Trisomy 11q: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approaches",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing a rare chromosomal disorder involving partial trisomy of chromosome 11q, affecting approximately 45 documented cases with predominant female occurrence.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 11, Partial Trisomy 11q, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the presence of three copies of the distal portion of chromosome 11's long arm instead of the normal two copies. The document details the clinical manifestations including prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, varying degrees of intellectual disability, distinctive craniofacial abnormalities, and other associated features. It emphasizes the necessity of chromosomal analysis for definitive diagnosis and outlines both prenatal and postnatal diagnostic approaches, including amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, and fetal blood sampling. The document serves as a clinical reference for healthcare professionals dealing with this extremely rare condition that predominantly affects females.",
