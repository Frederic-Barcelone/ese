  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Aniridia, Cerebellar Ataxia, and Mental Deficiency (ACAMD), also known as Gillespie syndrome. The text details this extremely rare inherited disorder that presents with three primary features: absence or partial absence of the iris (aniridia), impaired voluntary movement coordination due to cerebellar hypoplasia (cerebellar ataxia), and mental retardation. The document discusses the bilateral nature of the condition, its autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, and epidemiological data indicating only 20-30 reported cases in medical literature. It also notes the apparent female predominance and mentions that affected individuals may experience psychomotor retardation, representing approximately 2% of all aniridia patients.",
