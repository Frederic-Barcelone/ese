  "short_description": "Clinical overview of DMC and SMS syndromes, rare genetic disorders affecting skeletal development, including diagnostic approaches and characteristic findings.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Dyggve-Melchior-Clausen (DMC) and Smith-McCort (SMS) syndromes, rare genetic disorders that have been documented in over 90 individuals across various ethnic groups as of 2007. The text outlines the diagnostic process for DMC syndrome, which involves thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic features such as barrel chest and disproportionate short stature. It describes specific radiographic findings including vertebral body notching, lacy appearance of the iliac crest, and malformed carpal bones. The document also mentions genetic testing for DYM gene mutations as an alternative diagnostic approach, providing healthcare professionals with essential information for recognizing and diagnosing these rare skeletal dysplasias.",
