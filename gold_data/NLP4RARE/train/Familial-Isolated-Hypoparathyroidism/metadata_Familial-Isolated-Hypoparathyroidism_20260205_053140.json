  "short_description": "A group of extremely rare genetic disorders characterized by parathyroid glands that do not produce sufficient parathyroid hormone to maintain normal mineral balance.",
  "long_description": "This document provides an overview of familial isolated hypoparathyroidism, a collection of rare genetic disorders affecting the parathyroid glands' ability to produce or secrete adequate parathyroid hormone. The condition disrupts normal mineral homeostasis, leading to hypocalcemia (low blood calcium) and elevated phosphorus levels. The document explains the role of parathyroid hormone in calcium and phosphorus regulation within the endocrine system. It notes that most forms affect males and females equally, except for the X-linked variant which predominantly affects males. The true prevalence remains unknown due to potential underdiagnosis of mild cases in the general population.",
