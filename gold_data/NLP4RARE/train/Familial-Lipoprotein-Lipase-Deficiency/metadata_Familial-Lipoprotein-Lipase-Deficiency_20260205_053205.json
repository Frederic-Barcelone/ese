  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about familial lipoprotein lipase (LPL) deficiency, a rare genetic disorder. The document details the equal gender distribution of the condition, its estimated prevalence of 1 in 250,000 individuals in the general population, and its occurrence across all racial groups. It specifically highlights the significantly higher prevalence observed in Quebec, Canada, which is attributed to a founder effect - a genetic phenomenon where a small isolated founding population leads to increased frequency of specific genetic traits in subsequent generations.",
