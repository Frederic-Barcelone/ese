  "long_description": "This clinical document provides comprehensive information about Coats disease, detailing its epidemiological characteristics including the predominant male prevalence (69%) and typical age of diagnosis ranging from 8-16 years. The document outlines the diagnostic approach which involves thorough clinical ophthalmic evaluation, detailed patient history, and specialized imaging techniques including retinal fluorescein angiography, diagnostic echography, and computed tomography of the orbits. It also notes the bimodal age distribution with two-thirds of juvenile cases presenting before age 10, while approximately one-third of patients develop symptoms after age 30.",
