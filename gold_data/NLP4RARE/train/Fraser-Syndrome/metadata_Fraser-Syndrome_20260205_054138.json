  "short_description": "Clinical description of Fraser syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by syndactyly, renal abnormalities, genital malformations, and cryptophthalmos.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Fraser syndrome, a rare genetic disorder inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. The text details the characteristic features including partial webbing of fingers and toes (syndactyly), kidney abnormalities ranging from dysplasia to complete agenesis, and genital malformations that differ between males and females. In males, manifestations include cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and micropenis, while females may present with malformed fallopian tubes, clitoromegaly, and bicornate uterus. The document also describes the potential for complete eyelid fusion (cryptophthalmos) that can lead to blindness, as well as ear malformations causing hearing impairment. The text concludes with information about equal gender distribution, diagnostic approaches involving family history and physical examination, and confirmation through imaging studies.",
