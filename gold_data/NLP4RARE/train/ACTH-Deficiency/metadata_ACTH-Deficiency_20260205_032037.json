  "title": "ACTH Deficiency: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Considerations",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing ACTH deficiency, its pathophysiology, symptoms, and diagnostic approaches in patients with adrenal insufficiency.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) deficiency, a condition characterized by decreased or absent ACTH production by the pituitary gland. The document explains the pathophysiological cascade leading to adrenal insufficiency, detailing how reduced ACTH levels result in decreased adrenal hormone secretion and subsequent hypoadrenalism. It covers the clinical presentation including weight loss, anorexia, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and hypotension, while emphasizing the diagnostic challenges posed by these non-specific symptoms. The document discusses the epidemiology, noting equal prevalence between males and females and occurrence across age groups from infancy to adulthood. Diagnostic approaches are outlined, focusing on blood cortisol level assessment and ACTH stimulation testing as key diagnostic tools for confirming the condition.",
