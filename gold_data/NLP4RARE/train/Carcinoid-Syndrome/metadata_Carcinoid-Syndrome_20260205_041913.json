  "title": "Carcinoid Syndrome: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approaches",
  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical document detailing carcinoid syndrome, its pathophysiology, epidemiology, and diagnostic methods including biochemical and imaging approaches.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides an in-depth examination of carcinoid syndrome, a rare condition affecting approximately 10% of patients with carcinoid tumors. The document covers the pathophysiology involving hormonal substances like serotonin, bradykinins, and prostaglandins released when carcinoid cells metastasize to the liver. It discusses epidemiological data showing 27 new cases per million annually in the U.S., with equal gender distribution and slight prevalence in black African males. The document emphasizes diagnostic challenges and presents a multimodal diagnostic approach including biochemical investigations (24-hour urinary 5-HIAA, chromogranin-A), radiological imaging (CT, MRI, ultrasound), nuclear imaging (octreoscan), and histological confirmation. It highlights the classic triad of symptoms (flushing, wheezing, diarrhea) while noting that not all patients present with complete symptomatology, making diagnosis potentially overlooked.",
