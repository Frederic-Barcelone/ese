  "short_description": "Clinical overview of APS-1, a rare recessively inherited disorder caused by AIRE gene mutations, characterized by multiple autoimmune conditions affecting endocrine and gastrointestinal systems.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 1 (APS-1), a rare genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 2-3 million newborns in the United States. The document explains that APS-1 is caused by mutations in the autoimmune regulator (AIRE) gene and results in immune-cell dysfunction leading to multiple autoimmune conditions. It details how the syndrome presents with potentially life-threatening endocrine gland and gastrointestinal dysfunctions, and discusses the role of HLA-DR/DQ genes in determining which specific autoimmune diseases develop in patients. The document also addresses the epidemiological aspects, noting that while APS-1 can occur across various ethnic groups, it tends to cluster in certain homogeneous populations including Finns, Iranian Jews, and Sardinians.",
