  "short_description": "Clinical document describing ALAD porphyria, an extremely rare genetic disorder with few reported cases worldwide.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an epidemiological overview of ALAD porphyria, a rare metabolic disorder affecting porphyrin synthesis. The document discusses the global distribution of reported cases, with most occurring in Europe, gender distribution patterns, and age of onset characteristics. It highlights the challenges in accurate diagnosis and prevalence estimation due to potential underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of this condition. The document notes that while the disorder typically manifests during infancy or childhood, late-onset cases in adulthood have also been documented, emphasizing the variable clinical presentation of this rare genetic condition.",
