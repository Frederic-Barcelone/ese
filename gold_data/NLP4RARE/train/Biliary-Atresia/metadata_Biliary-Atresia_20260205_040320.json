  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical document describing biliary atresia, a rare gastrointestinal disorder affecting bile ducts in infants, including its pathophysiology, epidemiology, and diagnostic methods.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a detailed overview of biliary atresia, a rare pediatric condition characterized by the destruction or absence of extrahepatic bile ducts. The document covers the pathophysiology of bile duct obstruction and its consequences, including jaundice and liver fibrosis in affected infants. It presents epidemiological data showing the disorder affects approximately 1 in 10,000-15,000 births in the United States, with a slight female predominance. The document emphasizes biliary atresia as the leading cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in children. Comprehensive diagnostic approaches are detailed, including surgical evaluation through laparotomy with intraoperative cholangiography, liver biopsy, blood tests for liver enzymes and specific biomarkers like matrix metalloproteinase-7, and imaging studies. The document also mentions potential associated anomalies affecting the heart, intestines, spleen, and kidneys.",
