  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Eisenmenger syndrome diagnosis, including demographic patterns and diagnostic procedures.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical discussion of Eisenmenger syndrome, covering its demographic characteristics including equal gender distribution and high prevalence in Down syndrome patients (25-50% of adult cases). The text details the diagnostic approach, emphasizing that while diagnosis is not particularly complex, it may require invasive cardiac catheterization to measure heart and lung pressures. The document outlines various diagnostic tests including pulse oximetry for oxygen level assessment, chest x-rays, EKG, pulmonary function tests, iron level measurements, and complete blood counts. It highlights echocardiography as a fundamental tool for identifying underlying heart defects and detecting elevated pulmonary pressures, while noting that additional imaging modalities such as cardiac MRI can provide valuable anatomical information for comprehensive patient assessment.",
