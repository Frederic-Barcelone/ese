  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of choroideremia, a hereditary retinal degenerative disorder that predominantly affects males while female carriers typically remain asymptomatic. The document covers the genetic basis of the condition, including the unusual prevalence in the Salla region of northern Finland where approximately one in forty people are affected. It outlines diagnostic procedures including visual field testing and retinal examination, discusses available genetic testing options, and addresses current treatment limitations. The document emphasizes the importance of supportive care through vision services and genetic counseling for affected families, highlighting that while symptoms can be managed, no cure currently exists for this progressive eye condition.",
