  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of endomyocardial fibrosis and Loeffler's disease, focusing on current understanding of their etiology, epidemiology, and diagnostic approaches. The text discusses the evolution from historical theories attributing the conditions to filaria worm infections and malnutrition to current beliefs favoring unknown immunological processes as the primary cause. It details the geographic distribution of the disease as endemic to equatorial tropical regions, with rare occurrence in Europe and North America, and describes the typical patient demographics including children and young adults across all races. The document also covers diagnostic methodologies, emphasizing echocardiography as the primary diagnostic tool and the occasional use of heart muscle biopsy for confirmation.",
