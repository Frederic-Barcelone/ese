  "short_description": "Clinical document describing glutaric aciduria type I, a rare hereditary metabolic disorder caused by glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase deficiency affecting lysine metabolism.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of glutaric aciduria type I (GA1), a rare inborn error of metabolism affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 births. The document details the pathophysiology involving glutaryl-CoA dehydrogenase (GCDH) enzyme deficiency, which leads to accumulation of neurotoxic metabolites including glutaric acid, 3-hydroxy glutaric acid, and glutaconic acid. It covers clinical presentations ranging from macrocephaly and hypotonia in newborns to acute encephalopathic crises that can result in bilateral striatal injury and dystonic movement disorders. The document discusses biochemical subtypes (high and low excretors), diagnostic challenges including potential misdiagnosis as child abuse due to hemorrhages, and the importance of newborn screening programs. Special attention is given to genetic isolates with high carrier frequencies, including Old Order Amish, Oji-Cree First Nations, Irish Travelers, Lumbee, and Xhosa populations.",
