  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of autoimmune blistering diseases, a group of autoimmune disorders characterized by the body's immune system mistakenly attacking proteins essential for skin layer adhesion. The document covers the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, demographic patterns, and epidemiological data for these conditions. It discusses how these diseases primarily affect skin and mucous membranes, with symptoms varying significantly between individuals. The text addresses treatment approaches, prognosis, and emerging therapeutic research targeting specific antibodies. Epidemiological data is provided for various subtypes including pemphigus, dermatitis herpetiformis, epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and pemphigoid disorders, with incidence rates varying by population and geographic location.",
