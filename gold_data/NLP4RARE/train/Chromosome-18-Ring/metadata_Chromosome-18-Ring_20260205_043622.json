  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 18 Ring, a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by the loss of genetic material from chromosome 18 ends and subsequent ring formation. The document details the variable clinical presentation including mental retardation, hypotonia, growth retardation, recurrent infections, and craniofacial malformations such as microcephaly, ocular hypertelorism, and epicanthal folds. It explains the spontaneous embryonic origin of the condition, notes the slight female predominance among the 70+ reported cases, and discusses detection methods including prenatal testing and birth examination.",
