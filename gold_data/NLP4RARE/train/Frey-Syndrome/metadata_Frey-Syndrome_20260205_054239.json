  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Frey syndrome incidence, diagnosis, and the Minor Iodine-Starch Test used for detection.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Frey syndrome, a complication that commonly occurs following parotidectomy (surgical removal of the parotid gland). The document details the controversial incidence rates ranging from 30-50% of post-surgical patients, with approximately 15% experiencing severe symptoms. It explains the diagnostic approach using patient history, clinical evaluation, and the specialized Minor Iodine-Starch Test, which involves applying iodine solution and starch powder to detect excessive sweating through discoloration when patients are given acidic oral stimuli. The document notes that the condition affects males and females equally.",
