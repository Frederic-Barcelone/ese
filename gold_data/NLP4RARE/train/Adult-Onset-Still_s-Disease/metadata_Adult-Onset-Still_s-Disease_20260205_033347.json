  "long_description": "This document provides essential epidemiological information about adult-onset Still's disease, a rare inflammatory disorder that affects men and women equally (with some reports suggesting a slight female predominance). The condition primarily impacts young adults aged 16-35 years. The document highlights significant diagnostic challenges faced by healthcare providers, noting that the true incidence remains unknown due to the disorder's highly variable symptom presentation and rarity, which frequently leads to underdiagnosis or misdiagnosis in clinical practice.",
