  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the autosomal dominant inheritance pattern, genetic mutations, and epidemiology of hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO).",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of hereditary multiple osteochondromas (HMO), focusing on its genetic basis and inheritance patterns. The document explains that HMO is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in EXT1 and EXT2 genes, which function as tumor suppressors. It details the inheritance mechanisms, including that approximately 10% of cases result from new mutations, and discusses the 50% transmission risk from affected parents to offspring. The document also covers epidemiological aspects, noting equal prevalence between sexes but more severe manifestations in males, and addresses diagnostic challenges in mutation-negative patients who may have somatic mosaicism.",
