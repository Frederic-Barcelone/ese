  "short_description": "Clinical document describing COFS syndrome, a rare genetic degenerative disorder affecting brain, spinal cord, and multiple body systems from birth.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Cerebro-oculo-facio-skeletal (COFS) syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that causes degenerative changes in the brain and spinal cord beginning before birth. The document details the characteristic clinical features including growth failure, lack of neurological development, eye abnormalities, and skeletal deformities affecting the spine and joints. It explains the relationship between COFS and Cockayne syndrome spectrum disorders, discusses diagnostic approaches including physical examination, X-ray studies, neuroimaging, and specialized testing methods such as DNA repair studies on skin fibroblasts and molecular genetic testing for excision repair gene mutations.",
