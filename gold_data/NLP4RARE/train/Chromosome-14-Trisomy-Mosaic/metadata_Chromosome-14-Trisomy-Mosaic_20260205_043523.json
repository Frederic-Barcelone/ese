  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Chromosome 14 Trisomy Mosaic, a rare chromosomal disorder where chromosome 14 appears three times in some cells but not others.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides an overview of Chromosome 14 Trisomy Mosaic, a rare chromosomal condition characterized by the presence of three copies of chromosome 14 in some cells while other cells maintain the normal pair. The document explains the mosaic pattern of this genetic disorder, noting its apparent higher frequency in females compared to males. With over 20 cases reported since its original description in medical literature, the document emphasizes the importance of chromosomal testing for accurate diagnosis, as other chromosomal disorders may present with similar symptoms and findings. This resource serves as a clinical reference for healthcare professionals and researchers working with rare chromosomal abnormalities.",
