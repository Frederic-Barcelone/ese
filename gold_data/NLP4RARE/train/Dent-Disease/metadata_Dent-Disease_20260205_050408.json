  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Dent disease, a rare genetic disorder affecting kidney function. It discusses the limited data on incidence and prevalence, noting that Dent disease type 1 has been reported in approximately 250 families while type 2 has been documented in only about 25 individuals. The document highlights diagnostic challenges, including underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis that complicate accurate prevalence estimates. It emphasizes that the condition is fully expressed only in males and can present at various ages, from childhood through adulthood, making clinical recognition variable and sometimes delayed.",
