  "short_description": "A clinical guide describing ADTKD, a group of inherited kidney diseases affecting tubules that lead to chronic kidney disease and eventual need for dialysis or transplant.",
  "long_description": "This document provides comprehensive information about Autosomal Dominant Tubulointerstitial Kidney Disease (ADTKD), a rare group of inherited kidney disorders that specifically affect the kidney tubules. The guide explains the key characteristics of ADTKD including its autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with 50% transmission risk to children, the progressive development of chronic kidney disease typically detected through elevated blood creatinine levels, and the eventual requirement for dialysis or kidney transplantation between the 4th and 7th decades of life. The document also discusses associated complications such as elevated uric acid levels and gout, particularly in ADTKD-UMOD and ADTKD-REN subtypes, and emphasizes that these conditions are very uncommon but often affect multiple family members.",
