  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about beta thalassemia, a genetic blood disorder that affects hemoglobin production. While relatively uncommon in the United States with an estimated incidence of 1 in 100,000 individuals, it represents one of the most prevalent autosomal recessive disorders globally. The document highlights the geographic distribution of the condition, noting its particular prevalence in Mediterranean regions, the Middle East, Africa, central Asia, the Indian subcontinent, and the Far East. It also addresses risk factors for individuals whose families originate from these high-prevalence regions, providing important context for genetic counseling and screening programs.",
