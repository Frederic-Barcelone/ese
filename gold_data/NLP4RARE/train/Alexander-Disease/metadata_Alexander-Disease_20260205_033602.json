  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Alexander disease, a rare neurological disorder occurring in approximately 1 in 1 million births. The content discusses the lack of demographic preferences across racial, ethnic, geographic, or sex categories, which aligns with the de novo nature of the genetic mutations causing most cases. The document also notes the evolution in diagnostic patterns, highlighting that while Alexander disease was initially identified primarily in young children, it is now recognized with similar frequency across all age groups, indicating improved diagnostic capabilities and awareness of the condition's variable presentation throughout the lifespan.",
