  "short_description": "Clinical overview of goblet cell carcinoid, a rare tumor with unknown etiology affecting approximately 1 in 2 million individuals, typically diagnosed between ages 50-55.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of goblet cell carcinoid (GCC), a rare malignancy with an incidence of approximately 1 case per 2 million individuals. The text discusses the unknown etiology of GCC, including a potential but unestablished connection to schistosomiasis, and highlights recent genomic research showing GCC's distinct profile from other appendiceal tumors. The document covers key epidemiological features, including the typical age of diagnosis (50-55 years), gender distribution patterns, and the frequent misdiagnosis as ovarian cancer in women. It emphasizes the diagnostic challenges posed by GCC, noting that less than 1% are accurately diagnosed prior to surgery due to the lack of unique imaging characteristics, requiring pathological examination for definitive diagnosis through the identification of characteristic neuroendocrine and epithelial cell combinations.",
