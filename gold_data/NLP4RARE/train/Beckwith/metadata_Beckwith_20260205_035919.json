  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), a genetic disorder that affects both males and females equally. The document reports an estimated incidence rate of 1 in 13,700 individuals in the general population, while acknowledging that the true frequency may be underestimated due to mild cases going undiagnosed. This information is valuable for understanding the prevalence and diagnostic challenges associated with BWS in clinical practice.",
