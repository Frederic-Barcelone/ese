  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about ADCY5-related dyskinesia, a rare movement disorder that affects males and females equally. The content highlights the significant challenges in determining the true prevalence of this condition due to frequent misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis in clinical practice. The document emphasizes that ADCY5-related dyskinesia is likely underrecognized in the medical community, making accurate population frequency estimates difficult to establish. This information is crucial for healthcare providers and researchers working to improve recognition and diagnosis of rare movement disorders.",
