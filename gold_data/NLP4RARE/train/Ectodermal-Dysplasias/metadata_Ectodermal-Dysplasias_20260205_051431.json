  "long_description": "This document provides an introduction to ectodermal dysplasias, which represent a diverse group of rare genetic disorders that affect both males and females equally. The document highlights the epidemiological significance of these conditions, noting that an estimated 125,000 individuals in the United States are carriers for various forms of ectodermal dysplasia. These disorders typically involve abnormal development of structures derived from the embryonic ectoderm, including skin, hair, nails, teeth, and sweat glands, making them clinically significant conditions requiring specialized medical attention and genetic counseling.",
