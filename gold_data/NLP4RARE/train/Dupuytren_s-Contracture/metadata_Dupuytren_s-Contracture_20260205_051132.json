  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Dupuytren's contracture, a connective tissue disorder causing finger contractures due to palmar fascia thickening and fibrosis.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Dupuytren's contracture, a rare connective tissue disorder that affects the palmar fascia beneath the skin of the palm. The document details the pathophysiology involving abnormal thickening and shortening of fibrous tissue bands, leading to the formation of hardened nodules and fibrotic tissue that progressively draws fingers into a permanently flexed position. It covers the typical presentation affecting the ring and pinky fingers bilaterally, associated risk factors including alcoholic liver disease, diabetes, thyroid problems, and epilepsy, as well as potential genetic predisposition. The document also discusses diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history, and specialized testing methods such as histochemical tests and electron microscopy.",
