  "title": "Fascioliasis: Parasitic Liver Fluke Infection - Clinical Overview",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing fascioliasis, a parasitic infection caused by liver flukes that affects the liver and bile ducts through consumption of contaminated water plants.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of fascioliasis, a rare infectious disorder caused by parasitic liver flukes of the genus Fasciola. The document details the three distinct phases of infection (acute, latent, and chronic), each with characteristic symptoms ranging from fever and abdominal pain in the acute phase to gastrointestinal complications and jaundice in the chronic phase. It explains the transmission mechanism through consumption of contaminated aquatic plants like watercress, the parasite's lifecycle and migration through the human body, and diagnostic approaches including antibody testing and stool examination. The document also covers the geographic distribution of different Fasciola species and includes information about Halzoun Syndrome, a throat-affecting variant of the condition.",
