  "short_description": "Clinical document detailing the epidemiological characteristics and demographic patterns of atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS).",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS), a rare kidney disorder. The document outlines gender distribution patterns across different age groups, noting equal prevalence in childhood but higher female prevalence in adulthood, particularly related to pregnancy as a triggering factor. It presents incidence rates from studies in the United States (2 per million) and Europe (0.11 per million in ages 0-18), and establishes that aHUS represents approximately 5-10% of all hemolytic uremic syndrome cases. The document serves as a reference for understanding the demographic and epidemiological profile of this rare condition.",
