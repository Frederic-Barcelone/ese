  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of cerebral creatine deficiency syndromes (CCDS), which are rare inborn errors of metabolism that disrupt creatine formation or transportation. The document explains how creatine is essential for ATP production and cellular energy, particularly crucial for muscle and brain development. It details the epidemiology of different CCDS types, including CTD accounting for 1-2% of X-linked intellectual disabilities and GAMT deficiency affecting an estimated 1 in 115,000 to 1 in 2.6 million patients, with only 110 diagnosed cases worldwide as of 2015. The text addresses common misdiagnoses such as cerebral palsy, autism, and global developmental delays, and outlines diagnostic approaches including non-invasive screening through urine and plasma testing for creatine, guanidinoacetate, and creatinine concentrations, followed by genomic testing and brain MRI with spectroscopy for confirmation.",
