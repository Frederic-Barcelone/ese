  "title": "Gastroparesis: Clinical Syndrome of Delayed Gastric Emptying",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of gastroparesis, a digestive disorder characterized by delayed stomach emptying that primarily affects women and diabetic patients.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of gastroparesis (GP), a syndrome characterized by sluggish emptying of solid food from the stomach causing persistent digestive symptoms, particularly nausea. The text covers the demographic patterns showing a strong female predominance (80% of idiopathic cases), with diabetic and idiopathic causes representing the largest patient groups. It discusses diagnostic approaches using radiographic gastric emptying tests, various etiologies including post-surgical complications from procedures like fundoplication and bariatric surgery, and the need for differential diagnosis to rule out conditions like gastritis, gastric ulcers, and dumping syndrome that may present with similar symptoms.",
