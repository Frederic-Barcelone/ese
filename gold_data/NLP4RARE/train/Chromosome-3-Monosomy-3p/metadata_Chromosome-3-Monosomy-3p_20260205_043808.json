  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Chromosome 3, Monosomy 3p, a rare chromosomal disorder involving deletion of the end portion of the short arm of chromosome 3. The text describes the variable range and severity of symptoms, including prenatal and postnatal growth deficiency, severe to profound mental retardation, distinctive craniofacial malformations, synophrys, and hypertrichosis. The document notes that the condition typically occurs spontaneously, affects both sexes equally, and has been documented in approximately 34 cases since its first description in 1978. It emphasizes the importance of chromosomal analysis for accurate diagnosis and differential diagnosis from similar chromosomal disorders.",
