  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p, a very rare chromosomal disorder where the short arm of chromosome 18 appears four times instead of twice.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical description of Chromosome 18, Tetrasomy 18p, an extremely rare chromosomal disorder characterized by the presence of four copies of the short arm of chromosome 18 (18p) instead of the normal two copies. The condition affects both males and females equally, with approximately 40 cases documented in medical literature. The document explains the normal chromosomal structure, where individuals typically have two 18th chromosomes each containing a short arm (18p) and long arm (18q), contrasting this with the abnormal karyotype found in affected individuals who have four short arms present in their cells.",
