  "short_description": "Clinical document describing cold antibody hemolytic anemia, a rare autoimmune disorder causing premature destruction of red blood cells.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Cold Antibody Hemolytic Anemia (CAHA), a rare autoimmune disorder affecting approximately 1 in 80,000 people. The document explains the pathophysiology of premature red blood cell destruction by the body's immune system, epidemiological factors including higher prevalence in older adults and females, and associated conditions such as infectious mononucleosis and lymphoproliferative diseases. It details diagnostic approaches including blood examination for immature red blood cells, physical examination for organ enlargement, and the antiglobulin test (Coomb's reaction) which typically shows positive results for immunoglobulin M (IgM) in CAHA cases.",
