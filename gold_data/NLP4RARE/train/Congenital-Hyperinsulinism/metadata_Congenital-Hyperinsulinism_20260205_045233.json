  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of congenital hyperinsulinism (HI), a condition affecting approximately 1 in 25,000 to 50,000 births worldwide. The text details the epidemiology, timing of diagnosis, and clinical manifestations of HI across different age groups. It emphasizes the critical importance of early recognition and treatment to prevent brain damage, while highlighting the diagnostic challenges posed by symptoms that can be mistaken for normal infant behaviors. The document covers the spectrum of symptoms from mild presentations like irritability and lethargy to severe complications including seizures and coma, providing essential information for healthcare providers managing pediatric hypoglycemia.",
