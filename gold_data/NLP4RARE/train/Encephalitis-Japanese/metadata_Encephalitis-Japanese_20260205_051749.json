  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Japanese Encephalitis, a serious neurological condition caused by the Japanese B Encephalitis Virus. The document details the disease's geographic distribution primarily in Asia, its seasonal patterns with increased transmission during summer months, and its particular impact on pediatric populations. It covers the clinical presentation including neurological symptoms such as fever, headaches, weakness, and potential complications including paralysis, personality changes, and coma. The document also explains the pathophysiology, describing how the arbovirus is transmitted through infected mosquito bites and subsequently invades the central nervous system, causing selective nerve cell destruction and immune system compromise.",
