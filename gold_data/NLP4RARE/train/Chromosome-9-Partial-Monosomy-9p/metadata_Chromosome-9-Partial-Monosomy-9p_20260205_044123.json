  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 9, Partial Monosomy 9p, a rare genetic disorder caused by deletion of part of the 9th chromosome. The document details the characteristic clinical manifestations including intellectual disability, distinctive craniofacial features such as trigonocephaly and midfacial hypoplasia, congenital heart defects, and genital abnormalities. It notes that the condition typically results from spontaneous de novo mutations during early embryonic development, affects females more frequently than males, and has been documented in over 100 cases in medical literature since its original description.",
