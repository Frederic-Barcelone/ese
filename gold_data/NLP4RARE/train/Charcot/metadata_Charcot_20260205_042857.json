  "short_description": "Clinical document describing symptoms, progression, and diagnostic methods for Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, a hereditary neuropathy affecting peripheral nerves.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease, the most common inherited neurological disorder affecting over 250,000 Americans. The document details the gradual onset of symptoms typically beginning in adolescence, including muscle weakness, sensory loss, and characteristic physical manifestations such as foot drop, hammertoe, and high foot arches. It explains how the disease primarily affects the longest nerve fibers first and can lead to progressive loss of function in extremities. The document also covers diagnostic challenges and methods, including nerve conduction velocity testing, electromyography, and molecular genetic testing options for various CMT subtypes. The text emphasizes the variable nature of disease progression and notes that many cases remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed.",
