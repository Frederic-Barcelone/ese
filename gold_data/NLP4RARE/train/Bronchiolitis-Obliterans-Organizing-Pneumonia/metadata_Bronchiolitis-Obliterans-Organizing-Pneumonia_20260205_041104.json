  "title": "Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP): Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approach",
  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical overview of BOOP, a rare inflammatory lung disorder characterized by fibrous tissue plugs in bronchioles and organized inflammatory tissue in alveoli.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a detailed clinical overview of Bronchiolitis Obliterans Organizing Pneumonia (BOOP), a rare inflammatory lung disorder first described in the 1980s. The text covers the pathophysiology involving simultaneous inflammation of bronchioles and alveolar units, clinical presentation including flu-like symptoms and respiratory complaints, epidemiology affecting adults aged 40-60 equally across genders, and various etiologies ranging from idiopathic causes to medication-induced, radiation exposure, and systemic diseases. The document emphasizes diagnostic approaches including high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT) showing characteristic ground-glass opacities, pulmonary function testing, and various lung biopsy techniques for definitive diagnosis.",
