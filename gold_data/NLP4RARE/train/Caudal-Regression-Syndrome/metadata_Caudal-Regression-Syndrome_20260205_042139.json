  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the incidence and demographic characteristics of caudal regression syndrome, including its association with maternal diabetes.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on caudal regression syndrome, a rare congenital disorder. The document outlines that the condition affects both sexes equally with an estimated incidence of 1 in 5 per 100,000 live births. Importantly, it highlights the increased frequency of occurrence among infants born to mothers with diabetes, establishing a key risk factor for this developmental anomaly. This information is valuable for healthcare providers in understanding the prevalence patterns and risk stratification for caudal regression syndrome.",
