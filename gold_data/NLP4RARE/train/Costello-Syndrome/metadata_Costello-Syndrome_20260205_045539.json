  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides information about HRAS Costello syndrome, a rare genetic disorder caused by mutations in the HRAS gene. The document outlines the epidemiological characteristics of this condition, noting its extremely low prevalence with only approximately 350 cases reported globally. The syndrome demonstrates no gender bias, affecting males and females equally. This appears to be part of a larger clinical reference or research publication focused on rare genetic disorders and their clinical manifestations.",
