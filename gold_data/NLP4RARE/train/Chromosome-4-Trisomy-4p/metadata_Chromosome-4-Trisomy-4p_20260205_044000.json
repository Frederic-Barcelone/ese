  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Chromosome 4, Trisomy 4p, a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by duplication of the short arm of chromosome 4, resulting in severe developmental abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Chromosome 4, Trisomy 4p, a rare chromosomal disorder first described in 1970 and delineated as a distinct syndrome in 1977. The condition involves the presence of three copies (trisomy) of all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 4, rather than the normal two copies. The document details the variable clinical presentation, which may include feeding and breathing difficulties in infants, characteristic craniofacial malformations, hand and foot abnormalities, skeletal defects, cardiac abnormalities, and genital abnormalities in males. The severity and range of symptoms depend on the specific length and location of the duplicated chromosomal segment. The disorder is associated with severe mental retardation and affects males and females equally, with over 85 cases reported in medical literature.",
