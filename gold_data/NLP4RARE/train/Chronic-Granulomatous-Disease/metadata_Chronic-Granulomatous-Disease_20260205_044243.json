  "short_description": "Clinical document describing diagnostic methods for chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), including specialized blood tests to measure white blood cell oxidant production.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides detailed information about the diagnostic procedures used to identify chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a rare immunodeficiency disorder. The document explains how CGD diagnosis is based on comprehensive clinical evaluation, patient history, and specialized laboratory tests that measure oxidant production by white blood cells. It describes two primary diagnostic blood tests: the dihydrorhodamine 123 (DHR) test, which measures fluorescence caused by oxidants, and the nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) slide test, which produces a blue color reaction when oxidants are present. The document emphasizes that these tests can detect the absence or reduction of crucial oxidants that healthy white blood cells normally produce to destroy bacteria, and notes that genetic testing is typically recommended following positive diagnostic results to determine the specific type of CGD.",
