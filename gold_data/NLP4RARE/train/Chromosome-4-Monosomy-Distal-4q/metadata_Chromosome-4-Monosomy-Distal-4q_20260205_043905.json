  "short_description": "Clinical document describing a rare chromosomal disorder involving deletion of the distal portion of chromosome 4q, characterized by growth deficiency, developmental delays, and multiple congenital anomalies.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 4, Monosomy Distal 4q, a rare chromosomal disorder first identified in 1967 and characterized as a distinct syndrome in 1979. The document details the variable clinical manifestations associated with deletions of the distal portion of chromosome 4, including postnatal growth retardation, intellectual disability, craniofacial malformations, congenital heart defects, and limb abnormalities. It explains that the condition typically results from spontaneous de novo chromosomal errors during early embryonic development, affects both sexes equally, and has been documented in over 30 cases in medical literature. The document emphasizes the importance of chromosomal testing for accurate diagnosis and differential diagnosis from other similar chromosomal disorders.",
