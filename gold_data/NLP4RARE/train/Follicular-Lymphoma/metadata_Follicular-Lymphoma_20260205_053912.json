  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical document describing follicular lymphoma, a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affecting the lymphatic system, including its epidemiology and demographic characteristics.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a detailed overview of follicular lymphoma, explaining its classification as a form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and its impact on the lymphatic system. The document covers the anatomy and function of the lymphatic system, including lymph nodes, spleen, and bone marrow, and describes the role of B-lymphocytes and T-lymphocytes in immune function. It presents comprehensive epidemiological data showing that follicular lymphoma affects both genders with slight female predominance, has varying prevalence across ethnic groups, and represents the second most common subtype of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the United States and Western Europe, accounting for 30-35% of NHL cases and affecting 15-20,000 Americans annually.",
