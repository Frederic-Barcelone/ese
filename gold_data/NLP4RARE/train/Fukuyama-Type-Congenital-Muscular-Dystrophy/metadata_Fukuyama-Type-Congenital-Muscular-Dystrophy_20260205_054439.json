  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy, highlighting its prevalence in Japan and diagnostic methods including genetic testing and muscle biopsy.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Fukuyama type congenital muscular dystrophy (FCMD), a rare genetic disorder that shows significant geographic variation in prevalence. While virtually nonexistent in the United States, FCMD is the second most common form of muscular dystrophy in Japan, with an incidence of 0.7-1.2 cases per 100,000 children. The document outlines the multi-faceted diagnostic approach required for FCMD, which includes thorough physical examination, medical history assessment, blood tests for elevated creatine kinase levels, fukutin gene mutation analysis, electromyographic studies to identify affected muscle areas, and muscle biopsy to differentiate FCMD from other neuromuscular disorders. This information serves as a clinical reference for healthcare providers managing patients with suspected congenital muscular dystrophy.",
