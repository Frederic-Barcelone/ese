  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of acquired agranulocytosis, a rare hematological disorder caused by certain medications that results in dangerously low levels of granulocytes (white blood cells including basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils) in the circulating blood. The document covers the condition's etiology, risk factors including specific drug classes such as cancer drugs, alkylating agents, anti-thyroid medications, and dibenzepin compounds, diagnostic approaches combining patient history with laboratory confirmation, and monitoring protocols. It emphasizes the importance of regular blood testing for high-risk patients, with some cases requiring weekly monitoring, particularly for patients taking medications like clozapine.",
