  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of acromicric dysplasia, an extremely rare inherited disorder that primarily affects skeletal development. The document details the characteristic clinical features including abnormally short hands and feet, growth retardation with delayed bone maturation leading to short stature, and mild facial abnormalities. It discusses the genetic inheritance patterns, noting that while most cases occur sporadically, autosomal dominant inheritance cannot be ruled out. The document outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, imaging techniques, and specialized tests such as X-rays that reveal characteristic bone abnormalities in the hands and feet. Additionally, it describes cartilage biopsy findings that show distinctive abnormalities in growth cartilage, including disorganization of chondrocytes and collagen fibers, providing valuable information for healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and management of this rare condition.",
