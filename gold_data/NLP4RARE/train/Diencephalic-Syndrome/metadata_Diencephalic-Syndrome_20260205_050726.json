  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of diencephalic syndrome, a rare neurological disorder first described by Dr. Russell in 1951. The condition is caused by tumors located in the diencephalon, specifically affecting the hypothalamus and thalamus regions above the brainstem. The document details the characteristic clinical presentation including failure to thrive, progressive emaciation, and the paradoxical alert and happy demeanor of affected patients despite their physical appearance. It covers additional symptoms such as vomiting, vision abnormalities, headaches, and pallor, while outlining current treatment approaches including surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and molecular-targeted therapy. The document emphasizes the potential for life-threatening complications and notes that while the disorder primarily affects infants and young children, cases have been reported across age groups.",
