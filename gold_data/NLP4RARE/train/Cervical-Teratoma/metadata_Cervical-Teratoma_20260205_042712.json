  "title": "Cervical Teratomas: Rare Germ Cell Tumors of the Neck",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of cervical teratomas, extremely rare germ cell tumors occurring in the neck region, predominantly affecting children with benign characteristics.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of cervical teratomas, which are exceptionally rare germ cell neoplasms that develop in the neck region. Unlike the more common teratomas found in gonads or the sacrococcygeal area, cervical teratomas represent a unique subset affecting both males and females equally. The document details the epidemiological characteristics, noting that these tumors are predominantly benign when occurring in children but may present as malignant in the rare adult cases. With fewer than 50 adult cases documented in medical literature and germ cell tumors comprising only 3-5% of childhood tumors, this resource serves as an important reference for understanding the clinical presentation, demographics, and rarity of cervical teratomas in medical practice.",
