  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological data on Fabry disease, a rare genetic disorder that affects all racial and ethnic populations. It details the prevalence rates of different phenotypes, with type 1 classic Fabry disease affecting approximately 1 in 40,000 males, while the more common type 2 later-onset phenotype occurs 3-10 times more frequently, potentially affecting 1 in 1,500 to 4,000 males in some populations. The document also discusses geographic variations in incidence rates based on newborn screening studies and mentions the implementation of newborn screening programs in several U.S. states.",
