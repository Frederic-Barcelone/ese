  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about Cohen syndrome, a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder caused by mutations in the VPS13B/COH1 gene. The text discusses the epidemiological aspects of the condition, noting that it affects males and females equally and shows higher prevalence in certain populations including Finnish, Amish, Greek/Mediterranean, and Irish ancestry groups. With over 150 documented cases in medical literature and an estimated 500-1,000 diagnosed individuals worldwide, the document highlights the challenges in accurate diagnosis and the likelihood that many cases remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making true prevalence difficult to determine.",
