  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of alopecia areata, a disorder characterized by hair loss ranging from small patches on the scalp to more extensive hair loss throughout the body. The document explains that while the exact cause remains unknown, alopecia areata is believed to be an autoimmune condition where the body's immune system mistakenly attacks hair follicles. The text covers key clinical aspects including the unpredictable nature of hair loss, potential for regrowth, typical areas affected (primarily head and face), and demographic information showing equal prevalence between males and females with most cases beginning in childhood. The document notes that approximately 2.5 million individuals in the United States are affected by this condition.",
