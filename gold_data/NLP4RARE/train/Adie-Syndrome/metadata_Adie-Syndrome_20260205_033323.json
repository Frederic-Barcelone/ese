  "title": "Adie Syndrome: A Rare Neurological Disorder Affecting Pupil Function and Reflexes",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Adie syndrome (Holmes-Adie syndrome), a rare neurological disorder characterized by dilated pupils with poor light response and absent tendon reflexes.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Adie syndrome, also known as Holmes-Adie syndrome, a rare neurological disorder that primarily affects the autonomic nervous system. The condition is characterized by abnormal pupil function, typically presenting as dilated pupils that respond slowly to light, along with absent or diminished deep tendon reflexes. The document covers the epidemiology, showing a female predominance (2.6:1 ratio) and typical onset in young adults aged 25-45 years. It discusses various etiologies including idiopathic cases and secondary causes such as trauma, surgery, ischemia, or infection. The text also addresses associated conditions like Ross syndrome, treatment approaches including corrective lenses and pilocarpine therapy, and prognosis, noting that while the condition is generally non-progressive, the loss of deep tendon reflexes is permanent.",
