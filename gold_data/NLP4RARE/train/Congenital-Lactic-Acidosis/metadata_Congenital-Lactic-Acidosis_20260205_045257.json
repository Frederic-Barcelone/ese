  "short_description": "Clinical overview of congenital lactic acidosis covering incidence rates, diagnostic challenges, and testing methods for this metabolic disorder.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of congenital lactic acidosis, a metabolic disorder that affects both males and females equally. It discusses the epidemiological challenges in determining accurate incidence rates, with estimates suggesting 250-300 cases per 1,000 live births annually in the United States, though many cases likely remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. The document outlines the diagnostic approach, which relies on identifying characteristic symptoms, obtaining detailed patient histories, conducting thorough clinical evaluations, and performing specialized laboratory tests. Key diagnostic methods include blood and cerebrospinal fluid analysis to detect elevated lactate levels, as well as enzyme deficiency testing using white blood cells or tissue samples obtained through biopsy procedures.",
