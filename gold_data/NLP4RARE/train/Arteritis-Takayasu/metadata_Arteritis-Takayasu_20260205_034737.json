  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Takayasu arteritis, a rare autoimmune vasculitis that causes progressive inflammation of large arteries including the aorta and pulmonary arteries. The document details the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations including segmental stenosis and aortic regurgitation, demographic patterns showing predominance in females (80-90% of cases), geographic distribution with higher prevalence in Japan and Asia, typical age of onset between 15-35 years, and epidemiological data indicating 2-3 new cases per million annually in the US population. The content serves as an educational resource for healthcare professionals to understand this complex vascular disorder and its clinical implications.",
