  "long_description": "This document provides information about Congenital Varicella Syndrome, an extremely rare congenital disorder that occurs when pregnant women contract varicella zoster (chickenpox) infection during the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. The syndrome affects newborns with various abnormalities including low birth weight and characteristic defects of the skin, extremities (arms, legs, hands, and feet), brain, eyes, and potentially other body systems. The document explains that the range and severity of symptoms can vary significantly between cases, depending on the specific timing of the maternal infection during fetal development. This clinical information is valuable for healthcare providers and families understanding the potential consequences of varicella zoster infection during pregnancy.",
