  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides an epidemiological overview of hepatorenal syndrome, detailing its equal prevalence across genders and estimated occurrence rate of 8-10% in patients with ascites and cirrhosis. The document explains that while hepatorenal syndrome is most commonly associated with advanced cirrhosis and ascites, it can also manifest in patients with other forms of liver disease, including fulminant hepatic failure. This information serves as foundational knowledge for understanding the scope and clinical context of hepatorenal syndrome in hepatology practice.",
