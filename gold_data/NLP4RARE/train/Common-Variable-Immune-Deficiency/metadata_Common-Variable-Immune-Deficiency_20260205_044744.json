  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Common Variable Immune Deficiency (CVID), a primary immunodeficiency disorder caused by genetic mutations affecting immune system function. The document explains that CVID is one of over 180 primary immunodeficiencies recognized by the World Health Organization, with equal prevalence between males and females at approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals. It details important diagnostic considerations, including the fact that CVID diagnosis is not made in children under 4 years of age due to potential confusion with other genetic defects and physiologic immaturity, and notes that most patients are diagnosed between ages 20-40 despite earlier symptom onset.",
