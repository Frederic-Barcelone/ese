  "short_description": "Clinical overview of aceruloplasminemia, an extremely rare genetic disorder affecting iron metabolism equally in males and females.",
  "long_description": "This document provides essential clinical information about aceruloplasminemia, a rare genetic disorder first described in medical literature in 1992. The text discusses the epidemiology of this condition, noting its extremely low prevalence with an estimated incidence of 1 in 2,000,000 individuals in Japan, where it appears to be more common. The document highlights the challenges in determining accurate prevalence rates due to frequent misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis of the condition. The disorder affects both sexes equally and represents a significant diagnostic challenge for healthcare providers due to its rarity and potential for being overlooked in clinical practice.",
