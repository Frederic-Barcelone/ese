  "short_description": "A clinical document explaining focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a kidney disease characterized by scarring of the glomeruli that can lead to progressive kidney damage and failure.",
  "long_description": "This clinical educational document provides a comprehensive overview of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), a specific pattern of kidney damage affecting the glomeruli - the tiny blood vessel clusters that filter waste from the blood. The document explains the anatomy and function of the kidneys, describes how FSGS causes scarring and hardening of the glomeruli, and outlines the progressive nature of the disease that can ultimately lead to kidney failure. It covers the various causes of FSGS, noting that some cases have unknown origins, and discusses treatment approaches including medications, dialysis, and kidney transplantation for severe cases.",
