  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of branchio-oculo-facial syndrome (BOFS), a rare genetic disorder characterized by congenital defects of the head and neck region that are typically diagnosed during childhood. The syndrome affects males and females equally, with fewer than 100 cases documented in medical literature as of 2018, though additional patients are likely being treated worldwide. The document notes that fertility is generally unaffected in patients with BOFS, as evidenced by the occurrence of affected parents and children, and highlights the variable presentation of symptoms both within families and between different affected families.",
