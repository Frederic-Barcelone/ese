  "title": "Cystinuria: Inherited Metabolic Disorder Overview",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of cystinuria, an inherited metabolic disorder affecting amino acid transport and causing kidney stone formation.",
  "long_description": "This document provides essential clinical information about cystinuria, a hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by defective amino acid transport. The condition affects both males and females equally, with symptoms typically manifesting between ages 10-30, though elevated cystine excretion can be detected in infancy. With a prevalence of approximately 1 in 7,000 to 1 in 10,000 people in the United States, this disorder represents a significant clinical concern with varying prevalence rates across different countries. The document serves as a foundational reference for understanding the epidemiological and demographic characteristics of this inherited condition.",
