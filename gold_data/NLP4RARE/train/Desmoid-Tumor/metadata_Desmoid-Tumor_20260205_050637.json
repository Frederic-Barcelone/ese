  "title": "Desmoid Tumor: Clinical Characteristics and Diagnostic Approaches",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of desmoid tumors covering epidemiology, demographics, and diagnostic methods including biopsy and immunohistochemical analysis.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of desmoid tumors, rare neoplasms representing only 0.03% of all tumors with an incidence of 2-4 per million people annually. The document details the demographic characteristics, noting higher prevalence in individuals aged 10-40 years and a 2:1 female-to-male ratio, with particular occurrence in postpartum women. It emphasizes the diagnostic approach requiring tissue biopsy and microscopic examination, describing the characteristic spindle cell morphology and myofibroblast proliferation. The document also covers advanced diagnostic techniques including immunohistochemical staining for beta-catenin nuclear accumulation and differential antibody markers such as smooth muscle actin, desmin, and KIT to distinguish desmoid tumors from other neoplasms.",
