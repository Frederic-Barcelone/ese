  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Asherman's syndrome, an acquired gynecological disorder characterized by intrauterine adhesions causing menstrual irregularities and infertility.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Asherman's syndrome, an uncommon acquired gynecological condition that affects women's reproductive health. The document details the pathophysiology of the syndrome, which involves the formation of intrauterine adhesions and synechiae that reduce uterine cavity volume and cause endometrial scarring. It covers the characteristic clinical presentation including reduced menstrual flow, increased cramping, amenorrhea, and infertility. The document also discusses various etiological factors such as surgical procedures (D&C), endometrial infections including tuberculosis, and other contributing causes. Additionally, it addresses diagnostic approaches, emphasizing the importance of proper diagnostic techniques and highlighting hysteroscopy as the gold standard for accurate diagnosis, while noting potential limitations of alternative diagnostic methods.",
