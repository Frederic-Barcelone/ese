Common symptoms include severe pain in the upper right area (quadrant) of the abdomen, fever, chills, headaches, and a general feeling of poor health (malaise). Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a general term for infection of the upper genital tract in women. Infection is most often caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Chlamydia trachomatis. A diagnosis of Fitz-Hugh-Curtis syndrome is made through the exclusion of other causes of upper right abdominal pain. A diagnosis may be confirmed with a variety of specialized tests including x-ray examination, diagnostic laparoscopy, and certain l",

A diagnosis may be confirmed with a variety of specialized tests including x-ray examination, diagnostic laparoscopy, and certain laboratory exams. X-ray examination may include ultrasound, chest or stomach radiographs, and computed tomography (CT) scanning. X-rays are used to rule out other possible conditions or reveal characteristic inflammation of the perihepatic region. During a laparoscopy, a small, thing tube is inserted in the abdominal cavity through a small incision in the stomach. A laparoscopic exam allows a physician to view the liver and surrounding tissue. Laboratory exams can identify infection with Chlamydia trachomatis or",
