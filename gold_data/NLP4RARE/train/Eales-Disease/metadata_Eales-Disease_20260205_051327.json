  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Eales Disease, a rare ophthalmological condition characterized by inflammation and white haze formation around the outer coat of retinal veins. The condition typically affects young males and involves both eyes, presenting with sudden vision blurring due to vitreous hemorrhaging when the clear jelly filling the eyeball leaks out. The document discusses the unknown etiology of the disease, noting its spontaneous occurrence without identifiable precipitating factors such as injury, infection, or hereditary components, while also addressing the gender distribution of the condition.",
