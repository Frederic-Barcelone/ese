  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of cholera, detailing the pathophysiology of this acute infectious disease caused by Vibrio cholerae bacteria. The text explains how this gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium colonizes the small intestine without tissue invasion and produces toxins that stimulate massive fluid secretion, resulting in the characteristic watery diarrhea. The document covers the bacterial characteristics, mechanism of disease, symptom development, and notes that disease severity varies depending on the specific strain of V. cholerae involved in the infection.",
