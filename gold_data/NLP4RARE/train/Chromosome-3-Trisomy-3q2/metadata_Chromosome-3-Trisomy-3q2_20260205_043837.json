  "short_description": "Clinical documentation of a rare chromosomal disorder involving partial trisomy of chromosome 3, characterized by developmental delays and distinctive craniofacial abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 3, Trisomy 3q2, a rare genetic disorder where a portion of the third chromosome appears three times instead of twice in body cells. The document details the variable clinical presentation depending on the specific duplicated region, with common features including developmental delays, intellectual disability, and characteristic craniofacial abnormalities such as brachycephaly, ocular hypertelorism, and distinctive facial features. Additional manifestations may include ocular abnormalities, limb defects, congenital heart defects, and excessive hair growth. The document notes equal gender distribution, with at least 50 reported cases in medical literature, and discusses prenatal detection possibilities and typical diagnostic timing during birth or early infancy.",
