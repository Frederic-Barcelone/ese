The venous malformations may be tender, contain blood and be easily compressed and are usually located on the upper limbs, trunk and soles of the feet but can occur anywhere. The lesions increase in size and become more apparent over time but have not been reported to become cancerous. The organ system most commonly affected by BRBNS is the gastrointestinal (Gl) tract, particularly the small intestine. The lesions in the Gl tract often bleed and can lead to mild or severe anemia. Iron replacement and/or frequent blood transfusions may be required. The Gl lesions can also cause an obstruction or blockage (intussusception) of part of the bowel. Skeletal abnormalities and venous malformations in muscle are sometimes associated with BRBNS. Blue rubber bleb n",
