  "short_description": "A rare chromosomal disorder where chromosome 21 breaks at both ends and forms a ring, potentially causing mental retardation and various physical abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This document describes Chromosome 21 Ring, a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by breakage at both ends of chromosome 21, with the broken ends joining to form a ring structure. The severity of symptoms varies depending on the amount of genetic material lost during the breakage process. Affected infants may present with no symptoms if minimal genetic material is lost, or may exhibit significant developmental issues including mental retardation and abnormalities affecting the face, eyes, skeletal system, and internal organs when substantial chromosomal material is missing. The disorder affects males and females equally and represents an important genetic condition requiring clinical understanding for proper diagnosis and management.",
