  "long_description": "This document provides essential epidemiological information about hemophilia B, a bleeding disorder affecting approximately 1 in 25,000 male births. The content covers the comparative prevalence with hemophilia A, discusses the clinical presentation in carrier females including the 10-25% who develop mild to severe symptoms, and outlines the typical diagnostic timelines based on disease severity. The document emphasizes that hemophilia B affects all racial and ethnic groups equally, with severe cases typically diagnosed at birth or within the first two years, moderate cases around five to six years of age, and mild cases potentially remaining undiagnosed until adulthood.",
