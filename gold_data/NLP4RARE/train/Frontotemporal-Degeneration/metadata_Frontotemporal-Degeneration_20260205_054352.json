The content covers key demographic data including the typical age of onset in the late 50s with a broad range of 20-80 years, prevalence estimates of 50,000-60,000 affected individuals in the United States, and the significant challenges in accurate diagnosis that contribute to underreporting of this neurodegenerative condition.",
