  "long_description": "This document provides a detailed clinical description of chromosome 10, monosomy 10p, a rare congenital chromosomal disorder involving deletion of the end portion of chromosome 10's short arm. The document outlines the variable range of symptoms depending on deletion size and location, including severe intellectual disability, postnatal growth retardation, distinctive craniofacial malformations, short neck, and congenital heart defects. It also discusses the association with DiGeorge syndrome features in some cases, the spontaneous nature of most occurrences, and epidemiological data showing male predominance among the 46+ cases reported since 1970.",
