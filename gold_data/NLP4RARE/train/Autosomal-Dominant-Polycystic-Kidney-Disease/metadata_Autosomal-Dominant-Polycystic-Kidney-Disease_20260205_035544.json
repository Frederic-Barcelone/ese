  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological data on Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD), detailing its equal prevalence among males and females, population statistics showing 1 in 400-1,000 people affected based on autopsy records, and annual diagnosis rates of approximately 6,000 new cases in the United States. The document highlights that ADPKD accounts for 6-10% of dialysis and renal transplant patients in the US, affects an estimated 200,000-600,000 Americans and 12 million people globally, with only about 25% of affected individuals aware of their condition.",
