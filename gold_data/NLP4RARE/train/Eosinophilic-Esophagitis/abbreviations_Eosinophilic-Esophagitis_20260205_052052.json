The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach. Eosinophils are an important part of the immune system and play a role in immune regulation and fighting certain infection, and their accumulation is a hallmark of a",

Common symptoms include difficulty swallowing (dysphagia); food getting stuck in the throat (impaction); nausea; vomiting; poor growth; weight loss; stomach pain; poor appetite; and malnutrition. Because of an overlap of these symptoms with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), many patients are initially thought to have GERD, but EoE patients do not typically respond to anti-GERD therapy and can be found not to have GERD upon diagnostic workup. Recently, it has been appreciated that some patients with pronounced esophageal eosinophilia can have complete responses to proton pump inhibitor (PPI) therapy, typically used for the treatment of GERD, but these patients with",
