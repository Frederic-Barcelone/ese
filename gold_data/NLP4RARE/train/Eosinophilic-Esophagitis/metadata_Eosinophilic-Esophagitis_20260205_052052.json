  "long_description": "This document provides a detailed clinical overview of eosinophilic esophagitis (EoE), a chronic immune-mediated disorder affecting the digestive system. The text explains the pathophysiology involving eosinophil accumulation in the esophagus, presents the variable symptomatology across different age groups including dysphagia, food impaction, and failure to thrive, and discusses diagnostic challenges particularly in differentiating EoE from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The document also covers the emerging understanding of PPI-responsive esophageal eosinophilia (PPI-REE) as a disease variant, the association with other allergic conditions, and epidemiological data showing the condition's global prevalence of approximately 1 in 1,000 children.",
