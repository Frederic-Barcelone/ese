  "short_description": "Comprehensive patient information document about giant cell arteritis (GCA), the most common blood vessel disorder in people over 50, covering symptoms, causes, and treatment options.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a detailed overview of giant cell arteritis (GCA), a vasculitis condition affecting medium and large-sized arteries primarily in individuals over 50 years old. The document explains the two main presentations: cranial-GCA affecting temporal and other cranial arteries, and large vessel-GCA involving the aorta and other major arteries. It covers the clinical manifestations including headaches, jaw pain, visual disturbances, and constitutional symptoms, while emphasizing the risk of sudden blindness if left untreated. The document discusses the unknown etiology involving immune system dysfunction, the strong association with polymyalgia rheumatica, and available treatments including corticosteroids and immunosuppressive medications. Epidemiological data is provided showing higher prevalence in Caucasians of northern European descent, with significant gender and geographic variations in incidence rates.",
