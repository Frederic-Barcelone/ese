  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical description of Chromosome 9, Tetrasomy 9p, an extremely rare chromosomal disorder characterized by the presence of four copies of the short arm of chromosome 9 (9p) instead of the normal two copies. The condition affects the normal chromosomal makeup (karyotype) and appears to have a slight male predominance. With only approximately 30 cases reported in medical literature, this disorder represents a significant chromosomal abnormality that requires specialized genetic understanding and clinical management.",
