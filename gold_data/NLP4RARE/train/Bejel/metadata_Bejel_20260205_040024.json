  "title": "Bejel: Endemic Syphilis - Clinical Overview and Diagnosis",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing bejel, a non-sexually transmitted infectious disease caused by Treponema pallidum endemicum, including its transmission, symptoms, and diagnostic methods.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of bejel, also known as endemic syphilis, a rare infectious disease in the United States but common in certain global regions. The document details the causative organism Treponema pallidum endemicum, a spiral-shaped bacterium closely related to the syphilis pathogen. It explains the non-sexual transmission routes including skin contact and shared utensils, describes the progressive stages of skin and bone lesions beginning in the mouth, and outlines diagnostic approaches including geographic patient history, darkfield microscopy examination, and laboratory tests such as VDRL and FTA-ABS. The document emphasizes the importance of differential diagnosis from venereal syphilis despite the organisms' microscopic similarity.",
