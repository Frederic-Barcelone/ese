  "short_description": "Clinical document describing cerebellar agenesis, a rare congenital disorder affecting the cerebellum, with focus on diagnosis and epidemiology.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of cerebellar agenesis, a rare congenital neurological condition characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the cerebellum. The document discusses the epidemiological aspects, noting equal prevalence between males and females, though exact incidence rates remain unknown due to the extreme rarity of isolated cases. It emphasizes the diagnostic challenges, explaining that definitive diagnosis requires postnatal MRI imaging rather than clinical assessment alone. The document also addresses prenatal diagnostic limitations, highlighting that neither ultrasound nor fetal MRI can reliably detect the condition before birth, with cases documented where normal brain ultrasounds at 20-25 weeks gestation were followed by cerebellar destruction in later pregnancy stages.",
