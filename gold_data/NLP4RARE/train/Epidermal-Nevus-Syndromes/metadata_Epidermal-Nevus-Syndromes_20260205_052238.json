  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical document describing epidermal nevus syndromes (ENSs), rare complex disorders characterized by skin lesions and associated extra-cutaneous abnormalities affecting multiple organ systems.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a detailed overview of epidermal nevus syndromes, a group of rare complex disorders characterized by epidermal nevi (skin overgrowths) accompanied by abnormalities in the brain, eye, and skeletal systems. The document covers the clinical presentation including neurological symptoms (seizures, cognitive impairment, developmental delays), skeletal malformations (spinal curvature, hip malformation, limb abnormalities), and ocular abnormalities (cataracts, corneal opacity, colobomas). It discusses the genetic basis involving postzygotic mutations resulting in mosaic patterns, epidemiological data showing occurrence in 1-3 per 1,000 live births, and diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, skin biopsy, and specialized imaging techniques. The document also addresses the controversy surrounding imaging protocols for children and mentions molecular testing availability for specific ENS subtypes.",
