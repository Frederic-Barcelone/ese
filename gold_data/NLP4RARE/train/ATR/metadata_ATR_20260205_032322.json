The content discusses the challenges in determining accurate prevalence and incidence rates due to underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of cases. With more than 20 documented cases in medical literature, the document highlights the rarity of this condition and the ongoing difficulties in establishing its true frequency in the general population, which has implications for clinical recognition and patient care.",
