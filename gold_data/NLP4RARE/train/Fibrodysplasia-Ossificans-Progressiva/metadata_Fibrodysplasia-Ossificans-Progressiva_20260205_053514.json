  "short_description": "Clinical document describing fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva, a rare inherited disorder causing abnormal bone formation in soft tissues and progressive joint immobilization.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), an extremely rare inherited connective tissue disorder. The document details how FOP causes heterotopic ossification, where bone abnormally develops in soft tissues including ligaments, tendons, and skeletal muscles. It explains the progressive nature of the condition, describing how skeletal muscles and connective tissues transform into bone, leading to joint immobilization and movement restrictions. The document covers key clinical features including congenital malformed big toes, cervical spine and rib abnormalities, and the typical progression pattern of joint ankylosis affecting the neck, shoulders, elbows, hips, knees, wrists, ankles, and jaw in a characteristic sequence.",
