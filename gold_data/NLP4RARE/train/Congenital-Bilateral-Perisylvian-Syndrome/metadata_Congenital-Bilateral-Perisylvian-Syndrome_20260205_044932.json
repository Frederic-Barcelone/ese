  "title": "Congenital Bilateral Perisylvian Syndrome (CBPS): Clinical Overview",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of CBPS, a rare neurological disorder characterized by bilateral perisylvian polymicrogyria, typically presenting with infantile spasms and various forms of epilepsy.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Congenital Bilateral Perisylvian Syndrome (CBPS), a rare neurological disorder first recognized in the early 1990s. The text details the typical presentation of CBPS, which is usually apparent at birth or early in life and can be diagnosed through characteristic physical findings and specialized imaging tests. The document covers the various seizure types associated with the condition, including infantile spasms that typically onset within the first six months of life, as well as other epileptic manifestations such as atypical absence seizures, atonic-tonic seizures, and tonic-clonic seizures that may develop between ages 2-12 years. The overview also discusses the equal gender distribution of the disorder, various radiological subtypes identified through MRI, and references recent research findings on polymicrogyria cases with bilateral perisylvian distribution.",
