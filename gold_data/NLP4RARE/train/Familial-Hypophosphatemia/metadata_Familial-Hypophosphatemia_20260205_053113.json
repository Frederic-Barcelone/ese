  "short_description": "Clinical overview of familial hypophosphatemia, a group of rare inherited disorders affecting kidney phosphate conservation and vitamin D metabolism.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of familial hypophosphatemia, describing a group of rare inherited disorders characterized by impaired kidney conservation of phosphate and altered vitamin D metabolism. The text explains how chronic hypophosphatemia leads to rickets in children, manifesting as bow deformities of the legs, growth plate abnormalities, and bone softening (osteomalacia). It details the clinical presentations across different age groups, including growth impairment and short stature in children, and osteomalacia in adults. The document also covers the various inheritance patterns of these disorders, including X-linked dominant, autosomal dominant, and autosomal recessive forms, distinguishing familial hypophosphatemia from other causes such as dietary deficiency or intestinal malabsorption.",
