  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical description of acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type, a rare congenital genetic disorder characterized by corpus callosum abnormalities, intellectual disability, and distinctive craniofacial and digital malformations.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a detailed clinical overview of acrocallosal syndrome, Schinzel type, a rare genetic disorder first described by A. Schinzel in 1979. The syndrome is characterized by underdevelopment or absence of the corpus callosum, moderate to severe intellectual disability, and distinctive physical abnormalities including craniofacial malformations (macrocephaly, prominent forehead, ocular hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures) and digital anomalies (polydactyly and syndactyly). The document discusses the variable presentation of symptoms, inheritance patterns (suggested autosomal recessive but often sporadic), equal gender distribution, and notes that over 25 cases have been documented in medical literature since its initial description.",
