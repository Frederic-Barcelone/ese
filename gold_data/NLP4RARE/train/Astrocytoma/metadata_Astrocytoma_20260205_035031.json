  "short_description": "Clinical document describing astrocytoma brain tumors, their grading system, demographics, and diagnostic methods including neuroimaging and biopsy procedures.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of astrocytomas, brain tumors arising from star-shaped astrocyte cells within the brain's supportive glial tissue. The document details the four-grade classification system of astrocytomas, outlining the typical age demographics and prevalence for each grade, from Grade I tumors primarily affecting children and teens to Grade IV astrocytomas most common in adults aged 50-80. It explains the diagnostic process, emphasizing the importance of clinical evaluation, patient history, and specialized testing including blood work, neuroimaging techniques such as CT and MRI scanning, and tissue biopsy with microscopic examination for definitive tumor typing and grading.",
