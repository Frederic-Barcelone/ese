  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides information about Hereditary Sensory and Autonomic Neuropathy Type II (HSAN2), focusing on its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic challenges. The document notes that HSAN2 affects males and females equally, but emphasizes that the exact incidence and prevalence remain unknown due to frequent misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis. This underdiagnosis makes it particularly difficult to establish the true frequency of the disorder in the general population, highlighting the need for improved awareness and diagnostic criteria among healthcare professionals.",
