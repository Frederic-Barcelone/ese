  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Ear-patella-short stature syndrome (EPS), also known as Meier-Gorlin syndrome, a rare genetic disorder first described in 1959. The syndrome is characterized by a triad of features including small ears (microtia), absent or small knee caps (patellae), and short stature. The document details additional clinical manifestations such as skeletal abnormalities, feeding difficulties, poor weight gain, and distinctive craniofacial features including microstomia, microcephaly, and micrognathia. As an autosomal recessive disorder affecting males and females equally, EPS is considered under-diagnosed with only approximately 35 cases reported in medical literature as of 2005, making accurate prevalence determination challenging.",
