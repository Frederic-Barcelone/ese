  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of cicatricial alopecias, distinguishing between primary and secondary forms of this condition. The text focuses primarily on primary cicatricial alopecias, where hair follicles are directly targeted by destructive inflammatory processes, contrasting them with secondary forms where follicle destruction occurs incidentally due to external factors like infections, burns, radiation, or tumors. The document explains the pathophysiology, emphasizing how inflammation affects the upper portion of hair follicles where stem cells and sebaceous glands are located, and clarifies that destruction of these critical structures results in permanent, irreversible hair loss due to the inability of follicles to regenerate.",
