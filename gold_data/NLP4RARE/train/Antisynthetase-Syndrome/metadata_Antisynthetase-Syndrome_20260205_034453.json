  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of antisynthetase syndrome, a rare chronic autoimmune disorder characterized by the presence of specific autoantibodies targeting proteins in the body. The document details the multi-systemic nature of the condition, including its primary manifestations such as muscle inflammation (myositis), joint inflammation (polyarthritis), interstitial lung disease, skin changes, and Raynaud phenomenon. It also covers the demographic characteristics of the disorder, noting its higher prevalence in females and typical onset in the 50s, while acknowledging the challenges in determining accurate prevalence due to potential misdiagnosis. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this complex autoimmune condition and its varied clinical presentations.",
