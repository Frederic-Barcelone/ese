  "short_description": "Clinical document describing subacute cerebellar degeneration, including paraneoplastic and alcoholic/nutritional types, their causes, demographics, and treatment approaches.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of subacute cerebellar degeneration (SCD), a neurological condition characterized by deterioration of the cerebellum and related brain structures responsible for muscle coordination and balance. The document distinguishes between two primary types: paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration, which may precede cancer diagnosis and typically affects males around age 50, and alcoholic/nutritional cerebellar degeneration, caused by thiamine (vitamin B-1) deficiency and more commonly seen in alcoholics. The text outlines the pathophysiology, demographic patterns, clinical presentations, and treatment strategies for each type, emphasizing the importance of addressing underlying causes such as cancer treatment or thiamine supplementation combined with alcohol cessation.",
