  "long_description": "This document provides an epidemiological overview of aspergillosis, a rare fungal infection caused by Aspergillus species. It discusses the challenges in determining exact prevalence due to lack of national surveillance and underdiagnosis of mild cases, while noting an increasing incidence trend in medical literature. The document presents global prevalence estimates for different forms of the disease, including allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (1-4 million people worldwide), chronic pulmonary aspergillosis (3 million people worldwide), and invasive aspergillosis (uncommon). It emphasizes that aspergillosis has been reported globally and can affect individuals of any age, though many forms remain rare.",
