  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of blue diaper syndrome, an extremely rare genetic metabolic disorder characterized by incomplete intestinal breakdown of tryptophan. The condition presents with distinctive symptoms including digestive disturbances, fever, irritability, visual difficulties, and the pathognomonic sign of bluish urine-stained diapers in affected infants. The document details the inheritance patterns (autosomal or X-linked recessive), epidemiology affecting both sexes equally, potential complications such as kidney disease, and diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation and demonstration of indicanuria through fresh urine sample analysis.",
