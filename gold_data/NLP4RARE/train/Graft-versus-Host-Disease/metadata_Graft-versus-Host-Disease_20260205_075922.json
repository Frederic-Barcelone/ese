  "long_description": "This document provides a detailed explanation of Graft versus Host Disease (GVHD), a serious complication that can occur in patients with deficient or suppressed immune systems following bone marrow transplantation or nonirradiated blood transfusions. The document covers the pathophysiology of GVHD, explaining how donor T cells recognize and react to foreign histocompatibility antigens on recipient cells. It describes the clinical manifestations including skin rash, intestinal problems, and liver dysfunction, and discusses risk factors such as patient age and HLA compatibility differences between donor and recipient. The document also explains the preparatory myeloablative treatments and the role of immunocompetent donor lymphocytes in disease development.",
