  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), a collection of rare autosomal recessive genetic disorders characterized by enzyme deficiencies that impair the adrenal glands' ability to produce essential hormones. The document explains how CAH affects the production of corticosteroids, mineralocorticoids, and androgens, leading to hormonal imbalances and compensatory overproduction of hormone precursors. It details the epidemiology of different CAH forms, highlighting that 21-hydroxylase deficiency is the most common variant affecting 1:10,000 to 1:15,000 people in the US and Europe, with notably higher prevalence among Yupik Eskimos (1:282). The document also distinguishes between classical and non-classical forms of CAH, providing prevalence data for clinical and research reference.",
