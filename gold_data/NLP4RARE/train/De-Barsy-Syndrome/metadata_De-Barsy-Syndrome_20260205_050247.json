With fewer than 50 cases documented in medical literature, the exact incidence and prevalence remain unknown due to potential misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis. The syndrome typically presents with obvious clinical manifestations at birth or during early infancy, making early recognition important for proper diagnosis and management.",
