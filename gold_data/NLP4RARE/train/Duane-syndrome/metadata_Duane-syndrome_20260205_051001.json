It details the condition's prevalence across diverse ethnic groups, noting that DS affects approximately 1-5% of individuals with strabismus. The document highlights key demographic patterns including the typical age of diagnosis (by age 10), gender distribution showing a female predominance (60:40 ratio), and the condition's occurrence across various ethnic populations. This information is valuable for understanding the scope and characteristics of this ocular motility disorder in clinical practice.",
