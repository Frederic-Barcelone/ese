  "short_description": "Clinical overview of CARASIL, an extremely rare genetic disorder characterized by small blood vessel damage in the brain leading to strokes and neurological symptoms.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of CARASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Recessive Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), an extremely rare genetic disorder affecting small blood vessels in the brain. The condition primarily affects individuals aged 20-50 years and can cause multiple strokes even without cardiovascular risk factors. The document details the pathophysiology involving white matter damage (leukoaraiosis), clinical manifestations including spasticity, pyramidal signs, pseudobulbar palsy, gait disturbances, and progressive dementia. It notes that approximately one-third of patients experience stroke-like episodes and discusses the epidemiological challenges in diagnosis, as the condition is often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, particularly outside of Japanese populations where it was first extensively described.",
