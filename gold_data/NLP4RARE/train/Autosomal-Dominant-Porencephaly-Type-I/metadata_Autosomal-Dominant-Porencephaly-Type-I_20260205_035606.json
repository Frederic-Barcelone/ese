  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides information about autosomal dominant porencephaly type I, a rare genetic neurological condition. The document discusses the epidemiological characteristics of the disorder, noting that it affects both males and females in equal proportions. It highlights the challenges in determining the true prevalence of this condition in the general population, as cases may frequently go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed. The document appears to be part of a larger clinical or research publication focused on understanding the frequency and diagnostic challenges associated with this inherited form of porencephaly.",
