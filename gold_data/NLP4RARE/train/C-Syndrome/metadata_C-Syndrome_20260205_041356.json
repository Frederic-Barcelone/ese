  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of C syndrome, also known as Opitz trigonocephaly syndrome, a rare genetic disorder resulting from gonadal mosaicism. The text explains the underlying mechanism of mosaicism, where individuals have cells with different genetic makeups, typically involving variations in chromosome numbers (45, 46, or 47 chromosomes). The condition arises from errors in cell division during early fetal development and affects males and females equally. With only approximately 70 cases reported in medical literature worldwide, this syndrome represents an extremely rare genetic condition requiring specialized clinical understanding.",
