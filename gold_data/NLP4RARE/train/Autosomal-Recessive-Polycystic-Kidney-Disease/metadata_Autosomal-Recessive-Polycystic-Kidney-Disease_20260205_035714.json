  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD), detailing its equal prevalence between males and females with an estimated incidence of 1 in 20,000 individuals in the general population. The document discusses diagnostic challenges, noting that while most patients are diagnosed in utero or at birth, milder cases may remain undetected until adolescence or adulthood. It emphasizes that ARPKD can affect individuals across all ethnic groups and acknowledges potential underdiagnosis in determining true population frequency.",
