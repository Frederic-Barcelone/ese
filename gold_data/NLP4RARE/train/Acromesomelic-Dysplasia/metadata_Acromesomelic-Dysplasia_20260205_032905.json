  "short_description": "Clinical overview of acromesomelic dysplasia, an extremely rare inherited skeletal disorder causing short-limb dwarfism with characteristic shortening of forearms, lower legs, hands, and feet.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of acromesomelic dysplasia, an extremely rare inherited progressive skeletal disorder that manifests as a specific form of short-limb dwarfism. The condition is characterized by two key features: mesomelia (shortening of forearm and lower leg bones relative to upper limbs) and acromelia (shortening of hand and foot bones). The document details the clinical presentation, including the characteristic very short hands, fingers, feet, and toes that become apparent in early childhood. It also provides epidemiological data on the three main types: Hunter-Thompson type (approximately 10 reported cases as of 2005), Maroteaux type (40-50 reported cases), and Grebe type (primarily found in Brazil with unknown case numbers). This appears to be a medical reference document for healthcare professionals dealing with rare skeletal disorders.",
