  "short_description": "A clinical overview of cerebral palsy, describing it as a non-progressive neurological movement disorder affecting muscle control and coordination.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of cerebral palsy, a neurological movement disorder characterized by impaired muscle control and coordination difficulties. The text explains that cerebral palsy typically results from brain injury during early development stages - either in utero, during birth, or within the first two years of life. The document emphasizes that the condition is non-progressive and presents epidemiological data indicating that cerebral palsy affects males and females equally, with an estimated incidence rate of 1-3 per 1000 infants annually in the United States, resulting in approximately 9000 new cases each year according to the United Cerebral Palsy Association.",
