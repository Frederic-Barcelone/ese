  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of essential thrombocythemia (ET), a rare blood disorder affecting fewer than 1 in 100,000 people annually. It details the epidemiological characteristics including the higher prevalence in women compared to men, typical onset in the mid-fifties with a wide age range including childbearing women who require special therapeutic considerations. The document distinguishes between the extremely rare inherited forms seen in children versus the more common acquired genetic mutations in adults, explaining how these genetic accidents occur naturally with aging but don't always result in disease manifestation.",
