  "short_description": "Comprehensive clinical document describing essential tremor (ET), a progressive neurological disorder characterized by involuntary rhythmic movements, affecting an estimated 7 million Americans.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a detailed overview of essential tremor (ET), the most prevalent tremor disorder and one of the most common neurological conditions among adults. The document covers the clinical presentation of ET, including its characteristic involuntary rhythmic movements primarily affecting hands and arms, as well as associated motor symptoms like ataxia and non-motor symptoms such as cognitive impairment, depression, and anxiety. It discusses the disorder's epidemiology, noting that it affects over 4% of the population above age 40 and can occur across all age groups, races, and ethnicities. The document addresses the complex etiology involving both genetic and environmental factors, the challenges in diagnosis due to frequent misdiagnosis as Parkinson's disease, and the clinical approach to diagnosis based on symptom identification and neurological evaluation.",
