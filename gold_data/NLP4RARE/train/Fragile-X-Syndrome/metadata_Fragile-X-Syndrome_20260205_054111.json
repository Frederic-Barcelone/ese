  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Fragile X syndrome describing intellectual disability, physical features, behavioral abnormalities, and prevalence rates in males and females.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Fragile X syndrome, a genetic condition characterized by intellectual disability that affects males more severely than females. The text details the progressive nature of physical manifestations including distinctive facial features, joint hypermobility, and other developmental characteristics that become more apparent with age, particularly after puberty. It covers associated symptoms such as motor and language delays, autistic behaviors, and various medical complications including cardiac and sensory issues. The document also presents epidemiological data showing the syndrome affects approximately 1 in 4,000 males and 1 in 6,000-8,000 females in the USA, with higher carrier rates in females, and notes its presence across all ethnic groups and races.",
