  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 18q- syndrome (also known as Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18q), a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by deletion of part of the long arm (q) of chromosome 18. The document details the variable clinical presentation including characteristic features such as short stature, intellectual disability, hypotonia, limb malformations, and distinctive craniofacial abnormalities including microcephaly, carp-shaped mouth, and midfacial hypoplasia. Additional manifestations may include visual and hearing impairments, genital malformations, and cardiac defects. The document notes the syndrome's spontaneous occurrence during embryonic development, its female predominance (3:2 ratio), and provides historical context since its first description in 1964 with over 80 recorded cases.",
