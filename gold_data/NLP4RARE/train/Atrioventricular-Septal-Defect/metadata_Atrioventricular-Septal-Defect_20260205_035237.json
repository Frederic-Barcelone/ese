  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of atrioventricular septal defect (ASVD), a group of rare congenital heart defects characterized by improperly developed atrial and ventricular septa and adjoining valves. The content covers diagnostic approaches including advanced imaging techniques such as MRI and echocardiogram, invasive procedures like cardiac catheterization for assessing defect severity and blood flow patterns, and angiography for enhanced cardiac visualization. The document also notes the typical presentation of abnormal EKG readings in children with ASVD, providing healthcare professionals with essential information for understanding this complex congenital cardiac condition.",
