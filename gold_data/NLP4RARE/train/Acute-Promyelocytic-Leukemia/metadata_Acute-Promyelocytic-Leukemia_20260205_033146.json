  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), a subtype of acute myeloid leukemia that represents 5-10% of all adult AML cases. The content details the annual incidence rate of approximately 2.2 cases per million people in the United States, affecting 600-800 individuals yearly. It examines demographic patterns showing a median diagnosis age of 40 years, with ethnic variations including higher prevalence in Hispanic populations and lower rates in African Americans. The document also addresses therapy-related APL, a rare complication that can develop following chemotherapy or radiation treatment involving topoisomerase II inhibitors.",
