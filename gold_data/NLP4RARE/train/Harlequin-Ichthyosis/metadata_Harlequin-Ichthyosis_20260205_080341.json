  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of harlequin ichthyosis, a severe rare genetic skin disorder that affects approximately one in 500,000 births. The condition is characterized by newborns being covered with thick, plate-like skin that cracks and splits, potentially distorting facial features and restricting vital functions like breathing and eating. The document details the immediate need for neonatal intensive care, the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, and epidemiological data showing equal prevalence between males and females with approximately seven cases annually in the United States.",
