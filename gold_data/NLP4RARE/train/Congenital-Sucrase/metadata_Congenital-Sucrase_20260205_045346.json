  "short_description": "Clinical document describing congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency, a rare inherited metabolic disorder affecting sugar and starch digestion in the small intestine.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID), a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by deficiency or absence of the sucrase-isomaltase enzyme complex in the small intestine. The document details the pathophysiology of the condition, explaining how the enzyme deficiency prevents proper absorption of sucrose and starch-derived nutrients. It covers clinical presentation including watery diarrhea and abdominal distension that typically manifests when sucrose or starches are introduced to an infant's diet. The document discusses epidemiology, noting the condition affects approximately 0.2% of North Americans but has significantly higher prevalence (10%) in Greenland and Canadian Inuit populations. It also addresses the natural history of the condition, including how starch intolerance often resolves in early childhood while sucrose intolerance may improve with age.",
