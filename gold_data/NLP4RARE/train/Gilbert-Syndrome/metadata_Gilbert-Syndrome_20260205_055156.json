  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Gilbert syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting bilirubin metabolism that causes mild hyperbilirubinemia.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of Gilbert syndrome, a benign genetic condition that affects bilirubin processing in the liver. The document covers key epidemiological information, noting that the disorder affects 3-7% of the general population with a male predominance, and is present from birth though often remains undiagnosed until late teens or early twenties. It discusses the diagnostic approach, which typically involves detecting mildly elevated bilirubin levels during routine blood work, and emphasizes that diagnosis requires the presence of hyperbilirubinemia without evidence of hemolysis or structural liver damage. The document also provides historical context, noting the condition was first described in medical literature in 1901.",
