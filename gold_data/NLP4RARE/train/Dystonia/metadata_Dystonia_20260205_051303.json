  "title": "Dystonia: Movement Disorders Overview",
  "short_description": "Comprehensive overview of dystonia, a group of neurological movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions causing abnormal movements and postures.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a detailed medical overview of dystonia, encompassing the broad spectrum of movement disorders characterized by involuntary muscle contractions that force the body into abnormal and sometimes painful positions. The content covers the varied symptoms ranging from sustained to intermittent contractions, the diverse causes including genetic and non-genetic factors, and the wide range of severity from mild intermittent symptoms to severe debilitating conditions. The document discusses diagnostic challenges, prevalence estimates affecting up to 300,000 people in North America, and various treatment approaches including medications, botulinum toxin injections, physical therapy, and surgical interventions. It emphasizes that dystonia can affect any demographic and highlights the distinction between focal and generalized forms of the condition.",
