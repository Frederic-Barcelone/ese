  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), a respiratory condition primarily affecting premature and low birth weight infants. The content details epidemiological data showing 10,000-15,000 annual cases in the United States, with highest risk among infants weighing less than 2.2 pounds. The document explains how improved medical advances have paradoxically increased BPD cases by enabling survival of more extremely premature babies. It outlines the diagnostic approach established since BPD's first description in 1967, including clinical evaluation methods, blood oxygen testing, chest radiography showing characteristic lung changes, and echocardiography to exclude congenital heart defects as alternative causes of respiratory distress.",
