  "short_description": "Clinical document describing essential iris atrophy, a rare progressive eye disorder characterized by pupil displacement, iris degeneration, and potential secondary glaucoma.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of essential iris atrophy, a very rare and progressive ocular disorder that primarily affects middle-aged females. The document details the characteristic features of the condition including pupil displacement, iris atrophy with degenerative areas, and iris holes. It explains the unilateral nature of the disease, its slow progression over time, and the potential complications including peripheral anterior synechiae formation and secondary glaucoma that can lead to vision loss. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this uncommon ophthalmological condition, though specific prevalence data remains unknown due to its rarity.",
