  "long_description": "This document provides information about Glucose Transporter Type 1 (Glut1) deficiency syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that impairs glucose transport into the brain. The content discusses the epidemiological characteristics of the condition, noting that it affects males and females equally and that its true prevalence remains unknown due to potential underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. The document indicates that several hundred cases have been documented in medical literature since the condition was first described in 1991, highlighting the ongoing challenges in accurately identifying and diagnosing this metabolic disorder.",
