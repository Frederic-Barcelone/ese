  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Goodpasture syndrome, a rare autoimmune disorder that primarily affects the kidneys and lungs. The document details the pathophysiology involving inflammation of kidney glomeruli (glomerulonephritis) and excessive pulmonary bleeding, along with the characteristic symptoms including hemoptysis, dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and anemia. It covers the potential progression to acute renal failure, discusses possible triggers such as upper respiratory infections, and outlines diagnostic approaches including the identification of anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies and urinalysis findings. The document serves as an educational resource for healthcare professionals to understand the clinical presentation, diagnostic criteria, and key features of this complex autoimmune condition.",
