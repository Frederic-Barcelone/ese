  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Bjornstad syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by twisted hair shafts (pili torti) and sensorineural hearing loss.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Bjornstad syndrome, an extremely rare inherited disorder first described in 1965. The document details the characteristic features including abnormally flattened and twisted hair shafts (pili torti), bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, and associated hair abnormalities such as dry, fragile, and coarse scalp hair with patchy alopecia. It covers the genetic inheritance patterns (both autosomal dominant and recessive), epidemiology showing over 30 reported cases with a female predominance, and diagnostic approaches including electron microscopic examination of hair shafts and specialized auditory testing for confirmation of nerve deafness.",
