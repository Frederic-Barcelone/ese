The text details the demographic distribution of the condition, noting its equal prevalence between males and females across all age groups and ethnicities. Particular emphasis is placed on the significantly higher incidence rate among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, where approximately 8% of the population is affected. The document also provides prevalence data for the severe form of the disorder in the general population, estimated at 1 in 1,000,000 individuals.",
