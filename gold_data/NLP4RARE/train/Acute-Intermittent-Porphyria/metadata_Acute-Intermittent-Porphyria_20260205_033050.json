  "short_description": "Clinical document detailing the prevalence, genetic inheritance patterns, and demographic characteristics of Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP).",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides comprehensive epidemiological data on Acute Intermittent Porphyria (AIP), a rare genetic disorder. The document presents prevalence statistics showing 5.9 cases per million people in Europe, with notably higher rates in Sweden due to founder effects. It discusses the significant finding that while approximately 1 in 2000 people inherit pathogenic HMBS gene mutations, only 1% of carriers develop symptomatic disease. The document also addresses demographic patterns, noting that AIP affects all ethnic backgrounds but may be underreported in African-American populations, and predominantly affects young to middle-aged women more frequently than men.",
