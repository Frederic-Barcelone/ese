  "short_description": "Clinical document describing distal myopathy, a group of rare genetic disorders causing progressive muscle weakness and atrophy in the hands, feet, and limbs.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of distal myopathy (distal muscular dystrophy), detailing the pathophysiology, inheritance patterns, and epidemiological characteristics of these rare progressive genetic disorders. The document explains how these conditions specifically affect distal muscles (those farther from the body's center) including muscles of the lower arms, legs, hands, and feet, while distinguishing them from proximal muscle disorders. It covers the variable age of onset from infancy to adulthood, autosomal inheritance patterns, and population-specific prevalence data for various subtypes including Udd distal myopathy in Finland and Welander distal myopathy in Sweden. The document serves as an educational resource for healthcare professionals seeking to understand the clinical presentation, genetic basis, and demographic distribution of these uncommon neuromuscular conditions.",
