  "short_description": "Document detailing the prevalence and geographic distribution of Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), the most common inherited ataxia in certain populations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about Friedreich's Ataxia (FRDA), a genetic neurological disorder. The document establishes that FRDA has a prevalence of approximately 1 in 40,000 people and represents the most common form of inherited ataxia in specific geographic regions including Europe, the Middle East, South Asia (Indian subcontinent), and North Africa. The document also notes that FRDA is rarely identified in other populations, highlighting the geographic and ethnic variations in the distribution of this genetic condition. This information is crucial for understanding the global burden and population-specific risk factors associated with this inherited neurological disorder.",
