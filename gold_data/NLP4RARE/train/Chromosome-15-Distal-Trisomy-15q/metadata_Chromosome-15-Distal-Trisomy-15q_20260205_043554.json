  "short_description": "Clinical overview of an extremely rare chromosomal disorder characterized by triplication of the distal portion of chromosome 15q, causing growth delays, intellectual disability, and distinctive physical abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Chromosome 15, Distal Trisomy 15q, an extremely rare chromosomal disorder first described in 1974. The condition involves triplication of the end portion of the long arm of chromosome 15, resulting in a spectrum of clinical manifestations including prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, intellectual disability, distinctive craniofacial malformations, skeletal abnormalities, genital defects, and potential cardiac anomalies. The document details the variable presentation depending on the length and location of the duplicated chromosomal segment, notes the male predominance (2:1 ratio), and emphasizes the importance of chromosomal testing for accurate diagnosis. With over 30 cases reported in medical literature, this resource serves as an essential reference for healthcare professionals managing patients with this rare genetic condition.",
