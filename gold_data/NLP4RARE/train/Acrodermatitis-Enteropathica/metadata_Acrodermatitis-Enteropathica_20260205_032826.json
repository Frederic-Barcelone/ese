  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the rare congenital disorder acrodermatitis enteropathica, its incidence, and acquired forms.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of acrodermatitis enteropathica (AE), a rare genetic disorder that typically manifests during infancy. The document covers the epidemiological aspects of the condition, noting its incidence of approximately 1 in 500,000 births with equal gender distribution. It discusses both congenital and acquired forms of the disorder, highlighting how zinc supplementation in parenteral nutrition has reduced acquired cases in developed regions, while noting higher prevalence in areas like Southeast Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where gastrointestinal malabsorption syndromes are more common. The document also addresses the potential for transmission from affected mothers to breast-fed infants.",
