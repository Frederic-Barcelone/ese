  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides comprehensive information about agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC), a rare congenital neurological condition affecting brain development. The document covers the pathophysiology of ACC, including its characterization as partial or complete absence of the corpus callosum structure that normally connects the two cerebral hemispheres. It discusses various etiological factors including genetic inheritance patterns (autosomal recessive and X-linked dominant), intrauterine infections or injuries during weeks 12-22 of pregnancy, and fetal alcohol syndrome. The document addresses clinical manifestations, noting that symptoms typically appear within the first two years of life in 90% of affected individuals, and discusses the spectrum of cognitive impacts from mild impairment to mental retardation. It also covers diagnostic approaches using neuroimaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound, epidemiological data suggesting an incidence of 7 per 1000 individuals, and the potential association with spina bifida.",
