  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Very Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (VLCADD), a rare genetic metabolic disorder that affects the body's ability to break down very long-chain fatty acids. The document explains that VLCADD is an autosomal recessive trait classified as a fatty acid oxidation (FOD) disease, occurring when the necessary enzyme is missing or malfunctioning. It clarifies the historical nomenclature confusion with Long-Chain Acyl-CoA Dehydrogenase Deficiency (LCADD) and notes that all previously diagnosed LCADD cases are now recognized as VLCADD. The text covers the disorder's discovery in 1992, its current incidence rate of 1:40,000 births, and the significant impact of newborn screening using heel-stick tandem mass spectrometry in early detection.",
