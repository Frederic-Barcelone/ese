  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Crohn's disease epidemiology in pediatric populations, highlighting demographic patterns and increasing incidence rates.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of Crohn's disease with specific focus on pediatric populations. It details the overall prevalence affecting 780,000 Americans, with 25% diagnosed by age 20, and examines demographic variations including age distribution, gender differences, and racial disparities. The document emphasizes the concerning trend of increasing pediatric cases, particularly very early onset (VEO) inflammatory bowel disease in children under 6 years old. It also addresses the more severe disease presentation typically observed in children and adolescents compared to adult patients, providing essential background information for healthcare providers managing pediatric Crohn's disease.",
