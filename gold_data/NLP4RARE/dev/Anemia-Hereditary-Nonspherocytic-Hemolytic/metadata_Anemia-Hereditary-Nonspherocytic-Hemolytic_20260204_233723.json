  "short_description": "A rare genetic blood disorder characterized by premature destruction of red blood cells, leading to anemia when replacement cannot keep pace with destruction.",
  "long_description": "This document provides an overview of hereditary nonspherocytic hemolytic anemia, a group of rare, genetically transmitted blood disorders that result in the premature destruction of red blood cells (erythrocytes). The condition leads to anemia when the body cannot replace red blood cells faster than they are being destroyed. The document explains that this disorder exhibits sex-linked inheritance patterns, affecting males more frequently and severely than females, with males experiencing more severe symptoms while females may have milder symptoms or remain asymptomatic.",
