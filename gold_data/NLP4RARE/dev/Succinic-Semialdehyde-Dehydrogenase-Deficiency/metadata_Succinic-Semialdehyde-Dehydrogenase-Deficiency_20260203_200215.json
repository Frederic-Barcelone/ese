  "short_description": "Clinical overview of SSADH deficiency, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder affecting GABA metabolism and causing elevated GHB levels.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSADH) deficiency, a rare inherited metabolic disorder. The text explains how deficient SSADH enzyme activity disrupts gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) metabolism, leading to abnormal accumulation of succinic semialdehyde and its conversion to 4-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB). The document details the biochemical pathways involved, the role of GABA as an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and the characteristic laboratory findings including elevated GHB levels in urine, plasma, and cerebrospinal fluid that serve as diagnostic markers for this autosomal recessive condition.",
