  "title": "Leukodystrophies: Rare Progressive Genetic Diseases Affecting Brain White Matter",
  "short_description": "Overview of leukodystrophies, a group of rare genetic diseases that cause progressive deterioration of the brain's white matter (myelin sheath).",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of leukodystrophies, which are rare, progressive, metabolic genetic diseases affecting the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves. The text explains how specific gene abnormalities lead to abnormal development or destruction of myelin sheaths, the protective covering essential for normal nerve function. It covers the varied neurological manifestations depending on which part of the myelin is affected, demographic patterns including age and gender predispositions, and current treatment approaches that focus on symptomatic and supportive care including medications for spasticity, seizures, and neuropathic pain. The document emphasizes the importance of genetic counseling for affected individuals and families.",
