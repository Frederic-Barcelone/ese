  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Floating-Harbor syndrome (FHS), a rare genetic disorder that affects males and females equally. The text discusses the challenges in determining accurate incidence and prevalence rates due to potential underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis of cases. It notes that approximately 100 cases had been reported in medical literature as of 2014, though some individuals initially thought to have FHS were later found not to carry mutations in the SRCAP gene, highlighting the complexity of accurate diagnosis and the importance of genetic testing in confirming the condition.",
