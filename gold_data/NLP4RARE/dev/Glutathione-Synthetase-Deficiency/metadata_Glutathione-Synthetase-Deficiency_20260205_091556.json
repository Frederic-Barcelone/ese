  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about glutathione synthetase deficiency, a rare inherited metabolic disorder. The condition shows no sex predilection, affecting males and females equally. The medical literature has documented more than 70 affected individuals across 50 families worldwide. However, the true incidence and prevalence remain unknown due to significant diagnostic challenges, including frequent misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of affected individuals. This uncertainty in case identification makes it difficult to establish accurate frequency estimates in the general population, highlighting the need for improved diagnostic awareness and screening protocols.",
