  "short_description": "Clinical document describing retroperitoneal fibrosis, a rare inflammatory disorder characterized by abnormal fiber-like tissue formation behind the peritoneum that can obstruct ureters.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of retroperitoneal fibrosis, a rare inflammatory condition involving abnormal fibrotic tissue formation in the retroperitoneal space. The document details the pathophysiology of the disorder, including how the fibrotic tissue spreads and commonly affects the ureters, potentially causing urinary obstruction. It covers the various etiological factors, noting that approximately two-thirds of cases are idiopathic, while other causes include methysergide medication (12% of cases), malignant tumors (8% of cases), and trauma or surgical injury. The document also presents epidemiological data, indicating a 2:1 male predominance and peak incidence in individuals aged 40-60 years, though it can occur at any age and is extremely rare in pediatric populations.",
