  "short_description": "Clinical document describing retroperitoneal fibrosis, a rare inflammatory disorder characterized by abnormal fiber-like tissue formation behind the peritoneum that often affects the ureters.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of retroperitoneal fibrosis, a rare inflammatory condition involving abnormal fibrosis behind the peritoneal membrane. The document details the pathophysiology of the disorder, including how the fibrous tissue growth commonly spreads to obstruct the ureters, potentially blocking urine flow from kidneys to bladder. It covers the various etiological factors, noting that approximately two-thirds of cases are idiopathic, while other causes include methysergide medication (12% of cases), malignant tumors (8% of cases), and trauma or surgical injury. The document also presents demographic information, indicating a 2:1 male predominance and typical onset between ages 40-60, though cases can occur at any age with extreme rarity in children.",
