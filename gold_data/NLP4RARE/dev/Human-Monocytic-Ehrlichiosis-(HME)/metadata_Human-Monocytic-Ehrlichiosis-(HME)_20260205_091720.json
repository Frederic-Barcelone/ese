  "long_description": "This document provides information about Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME), a rare infectious disease that belongs to the group of Human Ehrlichioses. The document explains that these diseases are caused by bacteria from the Ehrlichia family and describes the various forms of Human Ehrlichioses, including Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis, Sennetsu Fever, and Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis. While these conditions are caused by different strains of Ehrlichia bacteria, they share similar clinical presentations and symptoms, making this a valuable reference for understanding this group of tick-borne bacterial infections.",
