  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of trichothiodystrophy (TTD), a rare genetic disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000,000 newborns. The text details the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic evaluation of TTD, which affects males and females equally across all ethnic groups. Key clinical features include characteristic hair abnormalities, short stature, ichthyosis, intellectual impairment, and various bone and dental anomalies. The document outlines the diagnostic workup process, including detailed patient history, physical examination, neurological assessment, brain MRI imaging, and laboratory testing. The gold standard for diagnosis involves polarized light microscopy of hair shafts revealing the characteristic 'tiger-tail' pattern, though genetic testing is often required for confirmation due to overlapping features with other conditions.",
