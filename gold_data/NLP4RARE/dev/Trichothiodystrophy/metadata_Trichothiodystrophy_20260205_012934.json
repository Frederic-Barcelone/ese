  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of trichothiodystrophy (TTD), a rare genetic disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000,000 newborns. The text details the clinical presentation including characteristic hair abnormalities with tiger-tail patterns under polarized light microscopy, short stature, ichthyosis, intellectual impairment, and various developmental anomalies. It outlines the diagnostic workup process involving detailed patient history, physical examination, neurological evaluation, brain MRI for myelination patterns, and laboratory testing. The document emphasizes that while the classical tiger-tail hair pattern is typically diagnostic, genetic testing may be necessary for confirmation, noting that some patients may have mutations in yet-to-be-identified TTD-associated genes.",
