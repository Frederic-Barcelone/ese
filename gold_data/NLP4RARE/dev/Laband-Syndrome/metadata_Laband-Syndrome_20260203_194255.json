  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Laband syndrome (Zimmerman-Laband syndrome), a rare genetic disorder affecting craniofacial features, hands, feet, and gums.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Laband syndrome, also known as Zimmerman-Laband syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder. The document details the characteristic clinical features including gingival fibromatosis (abnormally large gums), abnormally long and thin fingers and toes, nail dysplasia or absence, and potential cognitive impairment. It discusses the inheritance patterns (primarily autosomal dominant with some autosomal recessive cases), diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation and specialized testing, and the typical timeline for diagnosis during early childhood when primary teeth emerge and gingival abnormalities become apparent.",
