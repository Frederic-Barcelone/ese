  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of ovotesticular disorder of sex development (ovotesticular DSD), an extremely rare condition affecting fewer than 1 in 20,000 births. The document explains how affected individuals are born with internal reproductive organs of both sexes, including various combinations of ovaries, testes, or combined ovotestes. It details the spectrum of external genital presentations from ambiguous to normal male or female appearance, and outlines the diagnostic approach involving chromosome analysis, genetic testing, hormone evaluation, imaging studies, and gonadal biopsy. With at least 500 documented cases, this represents the rarest form of disorder of sex development in humans.",
