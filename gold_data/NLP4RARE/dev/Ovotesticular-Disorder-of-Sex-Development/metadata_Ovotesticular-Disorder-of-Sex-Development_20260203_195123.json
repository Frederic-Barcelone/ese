  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of ovotesticular disorder of sex development (ovotesticular DSD), one of the rarest disorders of sex development in humans with an incidence of less than 1 in 20,000 births. The condition is characterized by the presence of both ovarian and testicular tissue in the same individual, with gonads that can present as any combination of ovaries, testes, or combined ovotestes. The document covers the clinical presentation, including typically ambiguous external genitalia that can range from normal male to normal female appearance, and outlines the diagnostic approach involving chromosome analysis, genetic testing, hormone evaluation, imaging studies, and gonadal biopsy. With at least 500 documented cases reported in medical literature, this resource serves as an important reference for understanding this complex intersex condition.",
