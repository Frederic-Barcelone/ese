  "title": "Banti Syndrome: Splenic Disorder and Vascular Obstruction",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Banti syndrome, a rare splenic disorder characterized by premature destruction of blood cells due to vascular obstruction and hypertension in splenic or hepatic veins.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Banti syndrome, a disorder affecting the spleen that leads to rapid and premature destruction of blood cells. The condition results from obstruction and abnormally increased blood pressure within splenic or hepatic veins, which can be caused by congenital abnormalities, blood clots, liver disorders like cirrhosis, increased arsenic intake, or long-term azathioprine therapy. The document details the epidemiology, noting equal gender distribution and higher prevalence in India and Japan compared to Western countries, potentially linked to arsenic levels in drinking water. It also outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, splenic venography, and MRI imaging techniques for confirmation of the condition.",
