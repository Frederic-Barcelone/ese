  "title": "Banti Syndrome: Splenic Disorder with Premature Blood Cell Destruction",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Banti syndrome, a rare splenic disorder characterized by premature destruction of blood cells due to vascular obstruction and increased pressure in splenic or hepatic veins.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Banti syndrome, a disorder affecting the spleen that leads to rapid and premature destruction of blood cells. The text explains the underlying pathophysiology involving obstruction and hypertension in splenic, hepatic, or portal veins, which can result from congenital abnormalities, blood clots, liver cirrhosis, or other vascular disorders. The document discusses various risk factors including arsenic exposure and long-term azathioprine use, particularly in kidney transplant patients. It highlights the geographic distribution of the condition, noting higher prevalence in India and Japan compared to Western countries, potentially linked to arsenic levels in drinking water. The text also covers diagnostic approaches, emphasizing the use of advanced imaging techniques such as splenic venography and MRI for confirmation of the diagnosis.",
