  "long_description": "This document provides essential clinical information about VACTERL association, a rare congenital condition affecting multiple organ systems. It discusses the epidemiological data showing an incidence of 1.6 per 10,000 live births, while acknowledging that the true frequency may be underestimated due to misdiagnosis or undiagnosed cases, particularly in children with milder presentations. The document explains the diagnostic challenges, noting that while some features are apparent at birth, others may not manifest for weeks, months, or years. It addresses the 2-3% recurrence risk for families with one affected child and discusses the limitations in prenatal diagnosis, as no specific laboratory test exists for VACTERL association. The diagnosis relies entirely on clinical assessment through comprehensive physical examination and specialized testing to identify the characteristic major and minor features of this complex condition.",
