  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides comprehensive information about agenesis of corpus callosum (ACC), a rare congenital neurological condition affecting brain development. The document covers the pathophysiology of ACC, including the absence of transverse fibers that normally connect the two cerebral hemispheres, and discusses various etiological factors such as genetic inheritance patterns (autosomal recessive or X-linked dominant), intrauterine infections, developmental injuries, and fetal alcohol syndrome exposure. It details the clinical presentation, noting that symptoms typically manifest within the first two years of life in approximately 90% of affected individuals, and addresses the spectrum of cognitive outcomes ranging from mild impairment to mental retardation. The document also discusses diagnostic approaches using neuroimaging techniques like MRI and ultrasound, the increasing recognition of the condition due to improved imaging capabilities, current incidence estimates of 7 per 1000 individuals, and the potential association with spina bifida.",
