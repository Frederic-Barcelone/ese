  "title": "AP-4-Associated Hereditary Spastic Paraplegia: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Considerations",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), its global prevalence, diagnostic challenges, and differentiation from cerebral palsy.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (AP-4-HSP), a genetic neurological disorder that affects individuals worldwide regardless of gender or ethnicity. The document emphasizes the diagnostic challenges associated with this condition, particularly its frequent misdiagnosis as cerebral palsy due to overlapping symptoms including spasticity, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and seizures. It outlines the characteristic neuroimaging findings such as thin corpus callosum, enlarged lateral ventricles, and white matter changes on brain MRI, while highlighting that definitive diagnosis requires genetic testing. The document underscores that AP-4-HSP is likely under-recognized in clinical practice due to its nonspecific initial presentations.",
