  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), an extremely rare soft tissue tumor representing only 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. The document details the key characteristics of ASPS including its slow-growing nature, typical presentation as painless masses in the leg or buttock, and its propensity for pulmonary metastasis. It explains the underlying genetic mechanism involving unbalanced chromosomal translocations found in tumor cells, emphasizes the demographic patterns showing predominance in adolescents and young adults (particularly ages 15-35), and notes the higher incidence in females under 25. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this rare malignancy's clinical presentation, epidemiology, and genetic basis.",
