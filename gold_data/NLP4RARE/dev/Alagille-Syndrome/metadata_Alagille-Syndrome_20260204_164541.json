  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Alagille syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems with variable symptoms and autosomal dominant inheritance patterns.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Alagille syndrome (OMIM #118450), a rare genetic disorder with an estimated incidence of 1:30,000 to 1:45,000. The document details the multi-system nature of the condition, affecting the liver, heart, skeleton, eyes, and kidneys, with symptoms typically manifesting in the first three months of life. Key clinical features include cholestasis, jaundice, growth issues, cardiac abnormalities, and distinctive facial features. The document explains the genetic basis involving JAG1 and NOTCH2 gene mutations, inheritance patterns including both familial and de novo cases, and the challenges in accurate diagnosis and prevalence estimation due to the variable presentation and potential for misdiagnosis.",
