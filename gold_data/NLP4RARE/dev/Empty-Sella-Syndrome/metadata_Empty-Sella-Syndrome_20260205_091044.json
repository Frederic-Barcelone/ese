  "title": "Empty Sella Syndrome: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approach",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing empty sella syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by enlargement or malformation of the sella turcica with potential pituitary gland involvement.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of empty sella syndrome, a rare neurological condition affecting the sella turcica structure in the skull that houses the pituitary gland. The document explains the pathophysiology of both partial and complete empty sella presentations, discusses primary versus secondary causes, and outlines the demographic patterns showing higher prevalence in middle-aged, obese women with hypertension. It covers the largely asymptomatic nature of the condition, potential hormonal complications, and diagnostic approaches using advanced imaging techniques including CT and MRI scanning. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this uncommon but clinically significant disorder.",
