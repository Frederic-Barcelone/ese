  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Andersen-Tawil syndrome prevalence, gender distribution, and diagnostic difficulties in the general population.",
  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Andersen-Tawil syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects both males and females equally. The text discusses the challenges in determining the true prevalence of this condition, noting that while over 100 cases have been documented in medical literature, many cases remain undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to establish accurate frequency data for the general population. This highlights the ongoing need for improved diagnostic awareness and recognition of this syndrome among healthcare providers.",
