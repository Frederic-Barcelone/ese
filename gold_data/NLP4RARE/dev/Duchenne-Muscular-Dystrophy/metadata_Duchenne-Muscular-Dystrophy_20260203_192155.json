  "long_description": "This document provides essential epidemiological and clinical information about Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), the most common form of childhood-onset muscular dystrophy. It details that DMD predominantly affects males with a prevalence of 1 in 3,500 live male births, typically manifesting between ages 3-5 years. The document contextualizes DMD within the broader spectrum of muscular dystrophies, noting that these conditions collectively affect approximately 250,000 individuals in the United States, establishing the significant public health impact of these genetic neuromuscular disorders.",
