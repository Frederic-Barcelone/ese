  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of trisomy 9p, a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by the presence of three copies of a portion of chromosome 9's short arm instead of the normal two copies. The document explains the basic genetics of chromosomal structure, including the designation of chromosome arms and banding patterns, and notes that this condition affects females approximately twice as frequently as males. With over 150 cases reported in medical literature since its first description in 1970, trisomy 9p represents the fourth most common type of trisomy after Down syndrome, Edwards syndrome, and Patau syndrome. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this rare genetic condition and its place within the spectrum of chromosomal abnormalities.",
