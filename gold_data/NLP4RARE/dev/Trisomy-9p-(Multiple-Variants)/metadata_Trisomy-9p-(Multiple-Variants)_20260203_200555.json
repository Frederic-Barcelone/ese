  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of trisomy 9p, a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by the presence of three copies of a portion of chromosome 9's short arm instead of the normal two copies. The document explains the basic genetics of chromosomal structure, including the designation of chromosome arms (p and q) and banding patterns. It notes that trisomy 9p predominantly affects females at approximately twice the rate of males, with over 150 cases documented in medical literature since its first description in 1970. The document positions trisomy 9p as the fourth most common trisomy syndrome, following Down syndrome (trisomy 21), Edwards syndrome (trisomy 18), and Patau syndrome (trisomy 13), making it a significant focus for genetic counseling and clinical management.",
