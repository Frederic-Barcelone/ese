  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about ameloblastic carcinoma, a rare malignant odontogenic tumor. The document details that this condition shows no gender preference, affecting males and females equally, and can occur across all age groups including pediatric patients. However, the mean age of diagnosis is approximately 30 years old, indicating a tendency toward younger adult presentation. This demographic data is essential for understanding the population at risk and informing clinical practice regarding screening and diagnosis of this uncommon oral and maxillofacial malignancy.",
