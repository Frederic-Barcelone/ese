  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of antiphospholipid syndrome (APS), detailing its classification as a rare autoimmune disorder that causes recurring thromboses throughout the body. The document explains the distinction between primary APS (occurring in isolation) and secondary APS (occurring with other autoimmune conditions like systemic lupus erythematosus). It emphasizes the variable presentation of symptoms depending on clot location and affected organ systems, while highlighting key epidemiological data including the predominance in women, particularly those with recurrent pregnancy loss, and its significant role in stroke cases among younger patients and deep vein thromboses.",
