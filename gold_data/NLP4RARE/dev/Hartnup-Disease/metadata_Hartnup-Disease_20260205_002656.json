  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Hartnup disease, a genetic disorder affecting amino acid transport, with epidemiological data showing equal gender distribution and estimated frequency of 1 in 30,000 individuals.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides an overview of SLC6A19 Hartnup disease, a rare genetic disorder that affects amino acid transport mechanisms. The document presents key epidemiological findings indicating that the condition affects both males and females equally, typically manifests in childhood and persists into adulthood. Based on newborn screening data from the United States and Australia, the document reports an estimated prevalence of approximately one in 30,000 individuals, though the exact number of affected people remains unknown. This information appears to be part of a larger clinical reference or research document focused on the characterization and understanding of this rare metabolic disorder.",
