  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Townes-Brocks syndrome, an autosomal dominant genetic disorder characterized by imperforate anus, ear abnormalities, and thumb malformations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS), a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SALL1 gene. The document details the characteristic clinical features including imperforate anus (the most common feature), ear abnormalities with associated hearing loss, and thumb malformations such as triphalangeal thumbs and preaxial polydactyly. It also covers less frequent manifestations including kidney dysfunction, heart abnormalities, and developmental issues. The document explains the genetic inheritance pattern, prevalence estimates of at least 1 in 250,000 births, and diagnostic approaches including clinical assessment and molecular genetic testing for SALL1 gene mutations.",
