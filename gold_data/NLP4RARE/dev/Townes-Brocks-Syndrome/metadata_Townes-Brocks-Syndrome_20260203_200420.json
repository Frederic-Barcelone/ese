  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Townes-Brocks syndrome (TBS), a rare autosomal dominant genetic disorder caused by mutations in the SALL1 gene. The document details the characteristic clinical features including imperforate anus (the most common manifestation), ear abnormalities with associated hearing loss, and thumb malformations such as triphalangeal thumbs and preaxial polydactyly. It also covers less frequent manifestations affecting the feet, kidneys, heart, eyes, and spine, as well as the occurrence of mental retardation in approximately 10% of cases. The document explains the genetic inheritance pattern, prevalence estimates, diagnostic approaches, and the availability of molecular genetic testing for confirmation of the diagnosis.",
