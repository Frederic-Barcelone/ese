  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of Baller-Gerold syndrome (BGS), a rare genetic disorder present from birth. The document outlines the characteristic features of this congenital condition, which primarily affects craniofacial development and limb formation. Key manifestations include distinctive skull malformations, facial abnormalities, and skeletal defects particularly affecting the forearms and hands. This appears to be educational or reference material for healthcare professionals or researchers working with rare genetic disorders.",
