  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare soft tissue tumor representing only 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. The document details the tumor's characteristics including its slow growth pattern, typical presentation as a painless mass in the leg or buttock, and its tendency to metastasize to the lungs. Key features discussed include the specific unbalanced chromosomal translocation found in essentially all ASPS cases, the demographic patterns showing predominance in adolescents and young adults (ages 15-35), and the higher incidence in women, particularly those under 25. The document emphasizes that this genetic abnormality occurs only in tumor cells and is not hereditary, with no familial clustering observed.",
