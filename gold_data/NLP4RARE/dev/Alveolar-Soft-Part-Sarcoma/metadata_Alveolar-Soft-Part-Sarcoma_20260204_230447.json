  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare slow-growing soft tissue tumor of unclear etiology that represents only 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. The document details the characteristic presentation as painless masses typically arising in the leg or buttock, with a notable tendency for pulmonary metastasis. Key features include the specific unbalanced chromosomal translocation found in essentially all cases, the predominant occurrence in adolescents and young adults (ages 15-35), and the higher incidence in females, particularly those under 25. The document emphasizes that this genetic abnormality is not hereditary and occurs only in tumor cells, with no familial clustering observed.",
