  "short_description": "Clinical document describing alveolar soft part sarcoma, a rare soft tissue tumor affecting primarily adolescents and young adults with characteristic chromosomal translocations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare soft tissue tumor representing only 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. The document details the tumor's clinical characteristics including its slow growth pattern, typical presentation as painless masses in the leg or buttock, and propensity for pulmonary metastasis. Key features discussed include the specific unbalanced chromosomal translocation found in essentially all ASPS cases, demographic patterns showing predominance in adolescents and young adults (ages 15-35), and higher incidence in females, particularly under age 25. The document emphasizes the sporadic nature of the condition with no familial clustering or ethnic predisposition.",
