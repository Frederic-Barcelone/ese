  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), an extremely rare soft tissue tumor representing only 0.2-1% of all soft tissue sarcomas. The document details the tumor's characteristic presentation as a painless mass typically arising in the leg or buttock, its propensity for pulmonary metastasis, and its unique genetic profile involving unbalanced chromosomal translocations. Key demographic information is presented, highlighting the tumor's predilection for adolescents and young adults aged 15-35, with a female predominance particularly in younger patients. The document emphasizes the sporadic nature of the condition, noting the absence of familial clustering and the somatic-only occurrence of the genetic abnormalities.",
