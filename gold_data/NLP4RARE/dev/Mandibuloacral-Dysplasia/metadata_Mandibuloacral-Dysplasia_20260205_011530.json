  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an epidemiological overview of mandibuloacral dysplasia, a rare genetic disorder affecting bone and connective tissue development. The document highlights the scarcity of reported cases, with approximately 40 cases documented in medical literature overall and fewer than 10 cases specifically of type B variant. The text emphasizes the diagnostic challenges associated with this condition, noting that many cases likely remain misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, which complicates efforts to determine the true prevalence of mandibuloacral dysplasia in the general population. This information is valuable for healthcare professionals and researchers working with rare genetic disorders.",
