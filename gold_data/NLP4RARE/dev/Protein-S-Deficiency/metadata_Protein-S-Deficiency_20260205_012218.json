  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about PROS1 protein S deficiency, a rare hematological disorder that impacts both male and female patients. The text discusses the challenges in determining the true prevalence and incidence of this condition, noting that while the common form has unknown frequency in the population, severe protein S deficiency is extremely rare and frequently goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This diagnostic difficulty contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the disorder's actual occurrence rate in the general population, highlighting the need for improved recognition and diagnostic protocols for this condition.",
