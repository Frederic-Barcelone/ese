  "short_description": "Clinical overview of protein S deficiency, a rare blood clotting disorder affecting both men and women with unknown exact prevalence.",
  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about PROS1 protein S deficiency, a rare hematological disorder that impacts blood coagulation. The text discusses the epidemiological challenges in determining the true prevalence and incidence of this condition, noting that while the common form affects both genders, severe protein S deficiency is extremely rare and frequently goes undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. This diagnostic difficulty contributes to the uncertainty surrounding the disorder's frequency in the general population, highlighting the need for improved recognition and diagnostic protocols for this potentially serious blood clotting disorder.",
