  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of cleidocranial dysplasia, a rare skeletal dysplasia with an estimated birth prevalence of 1 in 1 million. The condition is characterized by distinctive physical features including short stature, narrow sloping shoulders due to defective or absent clavicles, and specific craniofacial abnormalities. The document details the major clinical manifestations including premature fontanel closure, pelvic bone abnormalities, thoracic deformations, delayed tooth eruption, and various skeletal malformations. As an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, it affects both males and females equally and is apparent from birth, with approximately 1,000 cases documented in medical literature.",
