  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of cleidocranial dysplasia, a rare skeletal dysplasia with an estimated birth prevalence of 1 in 1 million. The condition is characterized by distinctive features including short stature, narrow sloping shoulders due to defective or absent clavicles, premature closure of cranial sutures, delayed fontanel closure, and various skeletal abnormalities affecting the pelvis, chest, and jaw. Additional manifestations include delayed tooth eruption, high arched palate, and irregular finger length. As an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, it affects males and females equally and is apparent from birth, with approximately 1,000 cases documented in medical literature.",
