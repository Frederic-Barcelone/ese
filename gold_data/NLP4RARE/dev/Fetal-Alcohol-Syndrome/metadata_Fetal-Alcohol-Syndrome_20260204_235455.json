  "short_description": "Clinical document describing fetal alcohol syndrome, its characteristic features, and prevalence as a leading cause of mental retardation.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), a condition resulting from maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy. The document details the characteristic pattern of mental and physical birth defects associated with FAS, including growth retardation, craniofacial malformations, brain abnormalities, and additional physical findings. It emphasizes the variable range and severity of symptoms across cases and discusses the cognitive and behavioral impacts, including mental retardation and learning disabilities that may occur even without obvious physical abnormalities. The document also provides epidemiological data, noting FAS occurs in approximately 1-2 per 1,000 live births in the United States and is recognized as the primary cause of mental retardation in the Western world.",
