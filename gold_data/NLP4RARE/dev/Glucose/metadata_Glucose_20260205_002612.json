  "short_description": "Clinical overview of glucose-galactose malabsorption, a rare inherited disorder affecting sugar transport and absorption in the small intestine.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of glucose-galactose malabsorption (GGM), an extremely rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by mutations on chromosome 22. The condition is characterized by the small intestine's inability to properly transport and absorb glucose and galactose due to dysfunctional transport enzymes. With approximately 200 cases documented worldwide and a higher prevalence in females, the disorder often presents with severe watery diarrhea and is frequently associated with consanguineous marriages. The document outlines the pathophysiology, epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approaches including the glucose breath hydrogen test used for confirmation.",
