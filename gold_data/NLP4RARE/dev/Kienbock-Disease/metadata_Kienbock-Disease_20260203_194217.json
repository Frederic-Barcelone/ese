  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Kienböck Disease, an acquired bone disorder affecting the lunate bone in the wrist, characterized by degenerative changes following injury or inflammation.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Kienböck Disease, an acquired bone disorder that affects the lunate bone in the wrist. The condition develops following injury or inflammation and is characterized by degenerative changes including softening, deterioration, fragmentation, or compression of the lunate bone. Patients typically experience recurrent pain, stiffness, swelling, and tenderness in the soft tissue overlying the lunate bone, with potential limitation of wrist range of motion. The document notes that many affected individuals have negative ulnar variance (shorter ulna than radius) and that the condition predominantly affects females, usually beginning in childhood. Diagnostic approaches include arthroscopic procedures, CT scans, and x-ray imaging, while healing may occur through new bone formation in some cases.",
