  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Kienböck Disease, an acquired bone disorder that affects the lunate bone in the wrist. The condition develops following injury or inflammation and is characterized by degenerative changes including softening, deterioration, fragmentation, or compression of the lunate bone. Patients typically experience recurrent pain, stiffness, swelling, and tenderness in the soft tissue overlying the lunate bone, with potential limitation of wrist range of motion. The document discusses the association with negative ulnar variance (shorter ulna than radius), the predominance in females, typical onset during childhood, and diagnostic approaches including arthroscopic procedures, CT scans, and x-ray imaging. While the exact etiology remains unknown, the condition is believed to result from wrist inflammation or injury, with healing potentially occurring through new bone formation in some cases.",
