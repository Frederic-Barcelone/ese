  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Kienbéck Disease, an acquired bone disorder that affects the lunate bone in the wrist. The condition develops following injury or inflammation and is characterized by degenerative changes including softening, deterioration, fragmentation, or compression of the lunate bone. Patients typically experience recurrent pain, stiffness, swelling, and tenderness in the soft tissue overlying the lunate bone, with potential limitation of wrist range of motion. The document notes that many affected individuals have negative ulnar variance (shorter ulna than radius) and that the condition predominantly affects females, usually beginning during childhood. While the exact cause remains unknown, the disorder is believed to result from wrist inflammation or injury, and diagnosis typically involves arthroscopic procedures, CT scans, and/or x-ray imaging.",
