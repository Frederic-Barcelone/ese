  "long_description": "This document provides information about Leukoencephalopathy with Brain Stem and Spinal Cord Involvement and Lactate Elevation (LBSL), a rare neurological disorder that was first documented in medical literature in 2002. The document discusses the rarity of the condition, noting that according to the nonprofit organization A Cure for Ellie, only about 100 individuals worldwide had been identified with LBSL as of April 2018. The text highlights the challenges in determining the true prevalence of LBSL and similar rare diseases due to frequent underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in clinical practice.",
