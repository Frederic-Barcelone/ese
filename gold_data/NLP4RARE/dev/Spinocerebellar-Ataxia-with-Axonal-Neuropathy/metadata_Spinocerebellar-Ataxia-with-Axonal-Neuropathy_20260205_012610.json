  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about Spinocerebellar Ataxia with Axonal Neuropathy type 1 (SCAN1), a rare neurological disorder that has been identified exclusively in one Saudi Arabian family. The document outlines the diagnostic approach for SCAN1, which relies on clinical history and physical examination findings rather than routine genetic testing. It notes that while DNA testing for mutations in the TDP1 gene is theoretically possible, such testing is currently only available through research protocols rather than clinical diagnostic services. This highlights the rarity of the condition and the limited clinical resources available for definitive genetic confirmation.",
