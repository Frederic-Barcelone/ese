  "long_description": "This document provides information about Binder type nasomaxillary dysplasia, a rare congenital condition that affects the development of the nose and upper jaw area. The condition affects males and females equally, but its exact incidence and prevalence remain unknown due to potential underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis in the general population. Current estimates suggest the syndrome occurs in fewer than 1 per 10,000 live births, though the true frequency may be difficult to determine given diagnostic challenges.",
