  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Barakat syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by hypocalcemia, kidney disease, and deafness.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Barakat syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting multiple organ systems. The text describes the typical clinical presentation including symptoms of hypocalcemia (muscle weakness, tetany, convulsions), kidney-related manifestations (proteinuria, hematuria, nephrotic syndrome), and sensorineural hearing loss. The document discusses the syndrome's epidemiology, noting approximately 180 reported cases worldwide with equal distribution across ethnic groups and genders. It also outlines important differential diagnoses including familial idiopathic hypoparathyroidism, progressive sensorineural deafness, autosomal recessive hypoparathyroidism with renal insufficiency, and deletion 22q11 syndrome, emphasizing the need for clinical awareness to improve diagnostic rates.",
