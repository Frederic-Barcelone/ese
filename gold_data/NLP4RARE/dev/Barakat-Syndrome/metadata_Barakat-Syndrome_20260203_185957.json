  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Barakat syndrome, a rare genetic disorder affecting approximately 180 reported patients worldwide. The syndrome presents with a triad of symptoms including hypocalcemia (leading to muscle weakness, tetany, and convulsions), kidney disease manifestations (proteinuria, hematuria, nephrotic syndrome), and sensorineural hearing loss. The document discusses the equal prevalence across ethnic groups and genders, diagnostic challenges including prenatal detection through ultrasound findings, and important differential diagnoses such as familial idiopathic hypoparathyroidism and deletion 22q11 syndrome. The content emphasizes the need for increased clinical awareness to improve diagnostic rates of this underrecognized condition.",
