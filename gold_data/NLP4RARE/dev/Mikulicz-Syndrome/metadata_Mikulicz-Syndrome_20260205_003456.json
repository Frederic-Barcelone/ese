  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Mikulicz syndrome, a chronic condition involving abnormal enlargement of head and neck glands associated with underlying systemic disorders.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Mikulicz syndrome, a chronic benign condition characterized by bilateral enlargement of salivary and lacrimal glands in the head and neck region. The document details the syndrome's association with various underlying systemic conditions including tuberculosis, leukemia, syphilis, Hodgkin's disease, lymphosarcoma, Sjögren syndrome, and lupus. It outlines key clinical manifestations such as xerostomia (dry mouth), enlarged parotid and lacrimal glands, and painless swellings of salivary glands. The document also discusses the increased lymphoma risk in affected patients and notes the clinical similarities with Sjögren syndrome, suggesting potential diagnostic overlap between these conditions.",
