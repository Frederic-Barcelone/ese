  "short_description": "Clinical document describing congenital heart block, a rare disorder affecting electrical conduction in the heart muscle.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of congenital heart block, a rare cardiac condition characterized by interference with electrical nerve impulse conduction that regulates normal heart rhythm and pumping action. The document explains that the severity of conduction abnormalities varies among affected individuals and notes that the condition affects males and females equally. It provides epidemiological data indicating that complete congenital heart block occurs in approximately one in 20,000 to 25,000 live births, establishing it as a rare but significant cardiac disorder present from birth.",
