  "short_description": "Clinical overview of melorheostosis, a rare bone disorder affecting 1 in 1,000,000 people, focusing on diagnostic imaging characteristics.",
  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about melorheostosis, an extremely rare bone disorder with an estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000,000 individuals. The content covers the epidemiological aspects, noting that both sexes are equally affected with approximately 400 documented cases in medical literature. The document emphasizes diagnostic imaging approaches, highlighting that while bone scans show markedly positive results and MRI typically demonstrates low signal intensity, X-ray imaging remains the preferred diagnostic tool. The characteristic radiographic appearance shows thickened, sclerotic bone lesions that create a distinctive pattern resembling dripping candle wax, which is pathognomonic for this condition.",
