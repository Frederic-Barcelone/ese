  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans. It details this rare peripheral vascular disorder that predominantly affects young to middle-aged male cigarette smokers, characterized by narrowing or complete blockage of veins and arteries in the extremities. The document covers the clinical presentation including severe rest pain, claudication, ulceration, Raynaud's phenomenon, and potential progression to gangrene. It discusses the strong association with tobacco use, diagnostic criteria requiring smoking history, and diagnostic methods including angiography. The content serves as an educational resource for understanding the pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic approach to this tobacco-related vascular condition.",
