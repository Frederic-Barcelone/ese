  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Buerger's disease, also known as thromboangiitis obliterans, a rare peripheral vascular disorder that predominantly affects young to middle-aged male cigarette smokers. The document details the pathophysiology involving narrowing and blockage of veins and arteries in the extremities, leading to reduced blood flow. It covers the clinical presentation including characteristic symptoms such as rest pain in lower extremities, claudication, ulcerations, Raynaud's phenomenon, and thrombophlebitis. The document also addresses severe complications including gangrene, discusses the strong association with tobacco use, and outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical assessment and angiographic confirmation.",
