  "short_description": "A clinical document describing lichen sclerosus, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder primarily affecting women, including its demographics, presentation, and diagnostic approach.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of lichen sclerosus, a chronic inflammatory skin condition that predominantly affects women before puberty or after menopause, with peak incidence between ages 40-60. The document details the epidemiology showing females are six times more likely to be affected than males, and explains that when the condition occurs in males it is termed balanitis xerotica obliterans. The text outlines the diagnostic approach, emphasizing the importance of thorough clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical features, detailed patient history, and assessment of functional impact. It also discusses the role of skin biopsy in confirming diagnosis and ruling out potential malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma.",
