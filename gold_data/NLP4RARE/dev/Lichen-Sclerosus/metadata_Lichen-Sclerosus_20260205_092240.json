  "short_description": "Clinical document describing lichen sclerosus, a chronic inflammatory skin disorder primarily affecting women, including demographics, diagnosis, and evaluation methods.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of lichen sclerosus, a chronic inflammatory skin condition that predominantly affects women before puberty or after menopause, with peak incidence between ages 40-60. The document details the epidemiology showing females are six times more likely to be affected than males, and explains that when the condition occurs in males it is termed balanitis xerotica obliterans. The text outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic physical features, detailed patient history taking with focus on functional impact and previous treatments, and the potential need for skin biopsy to confirm diagnosis or rule out squamous cell carcinoma.",
