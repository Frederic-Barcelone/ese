  "short_description": "An overview of soft tissue sarcomas as rare tumors affecting diverse populations, accounting for approximately 2% of all cancers in the United States.",
  "long_description": "This document provides an epidemiological overview of soft tissue sarcomas, emphasizing their classification as rare disorders despite affecting individuals across all demographics including men, women, people of all ages, and every racial and ethnic group. The document discusses the challenges in determining accurate frequency estimates for these tumors, noting that the American Cancer Society estimates they represent about 2% of all cancers in the United States. It highlights the diagnostic challenges inherent in rare diseases, which often leads to misdiagnosis or underdiagnosis, making it difficult to establish their true prevalence in the general population.",
