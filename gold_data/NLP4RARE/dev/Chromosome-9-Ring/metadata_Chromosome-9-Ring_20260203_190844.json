  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Chromosome 9 Ring, a rare genetic disorder caused by deletion and ring formation of chromosome 9 material.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Chromosome 9 Ring, a rare chromosomal abnormality characterized by the loss of genetic material from both ends of chromosome 9 and subsequent ring formation. The document details the variable clinical manifestations including craniofacial malformations, growth retardation, cardiac defects, genital abnormalities, and intellectual disability ranging from moderate to severe, though some individuals may have low normal intelligence. The condition typically results from spontaneous de novo errors during early embryonic development and affects males and females equally. With only 12+ cases reported in medical literature since its original description, this document serves as an important reference for understanding this extremely rare genetic condition.",
