  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Chromosome 9 Ring, a rare genetic disorder caused by deletion and ring formation of chromosome 9 material.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Chromosome 9 Ring, a rare chromosomal abnormality characterized by the loss of genetic material from both ends of chromosome 9 and subsequent ring formation. The text details the variable clinical manifestations including craniofacial malformations, growth retardation, cardiac defects, genital abnormalities, and intellectual disability ranging from moderate to severe, though some individuals may have low normal intelligence. The document explains that this condition typically results from spontaneous embryonic developmental errors, affects both sexes equally, and has been documented in more than 12 cases since its initial description in medical literature.",
