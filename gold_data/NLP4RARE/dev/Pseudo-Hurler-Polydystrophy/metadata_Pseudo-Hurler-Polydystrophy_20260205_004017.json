  "short_description": "Clinical document describing pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, a rare genetic metabolic disorder caused by enzyme deficiency leading to accumulation of complex carbohydrates and fatty substances.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis type III), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by defective UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase enzyme. The document details the pathophysiology involving accumulation of mucopolysaccharides and mucolipids in body tissues, clinical manifestations including progressive joint stiffness, skeletal deformities, growth delays, corneal clouding, and mild cognitive impairment. It compares the condition to the more severe I-cell disease and outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, and specialized laboratory tests measuring lysosomal enzyme activity in serum and cellular samples.",
