  "title": "Pseudo-Hurler Polydystrophy (Mucolipidosis Type III): Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approach",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy, a rare genetic metabolic disorder caused by enzyme deficiency leading to accumulation of complex carbohydrates and fatty substances.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of pseudo-Hurler polydystrophy (mucolipidosis type III), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder. The document details the underlying pathophysiology involving defective UPD-N-acetylglucosamine-1-phosphotransferase enzyme, which leads to accumulation of mucopolysaccharides and mucolipids in body tissues. It describes the clinical presentation including progressive joint stiffness, skeletal deformities, growth delays, corneal clouding, and mild cognitive impairment. The document also outlines diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, and specialized laboratory tests measuring lysosomal enzyme activity in serum and cellular samples.",
