  "short_description": "Clinical document describing carnosinemia, a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by developmental delays, seizures, and intellectual disability in infants and children.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of carnosinemia, an extremely rare inherited metabolic disorder affecting approximately 30 individuals worldwide. The document details the clinical presentation including early-onset symptoms such as extreme drowsiness, myoclonic seizures, and developmental delays that typically manifest in infancy. It describes the progressive nature of the condition, including intellectual disabilities, motor delays, low muscle tone, and potential muscle weakness. The document also covers diagnostic approaches, emphasizing amino acid analysis of blood and urine samples that reveal elevated carnosine and anserine levels, as well as specialized testing for carnosinase enzyme activity. This resource serves as a clinical reference for healthcare professionals managing patients with suspected or confirmed carnosinemia.",
