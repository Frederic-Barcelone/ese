  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical document describing Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a rare congenital genetic disorder characterized by growth retardation, distinctive facial features, limb malformations, and intellectual disability.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a detailed overview of Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS), a rare genetic disorder present from birth that affects approximately 1 in 10,000 live births. The document comprehensively describes the characteristic clinical features including prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, distinctive craniofacial abnormalities such as microbrachycephaly and synophrys, upper limb malformations ranging from minor digit abnormalities to complete absence of forearms, and associated complications including feeding difficulties, respiratory issues, cardiac defects, and varying degrees of intellectual disability. The text emphasizes the highly variable presentation of the syndrome and provides epidemiological data indicating equal gender distribution and familial recurrence patterns, making it a valuable resource for healthcare professionals involved in diagnosis and management of this complex genetic condition.",
