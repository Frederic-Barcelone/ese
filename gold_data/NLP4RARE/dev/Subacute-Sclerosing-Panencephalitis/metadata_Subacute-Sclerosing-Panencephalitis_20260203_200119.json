  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a rare but serious progressive neurological disorder characterized by brain inflammation. The condition develops 2-10 years after initial measles infection due to viral reactivation or inappropriate immune response. The document details the clinical presentation including memory loss, irritability, seizures, involuntary muscle movements, and behavioral changes that lead to progressive neurological deterioration. It highlights the dramatic reduction in SSPE incidence in developed countries like the United States (approximately 10 cases annually) following widespread measles vaccination, while noting significantly higher rates in developing regions such as India (20 cases per million population annually). The document also notes the demographic patterns, with males being more frequently affected than females, and children and adolescents showing higher susceptibility than adults.",
