  "short_description": "Clinical document describing multifocal motor neuropathy, a rare immune-mediated disorder causing progressive muscle weakness primarily in arms and legs.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of multifocal motor neuropathy, a rare acquired neurological disorder affecting approximately 0.6 per 100,000 individuals. The document details the pathophysiology as an immune-mediated condition involving autoantibodies targeting specific proteins, leading to inflammation and progressive muscle weakness. It covers clinical presentation including muscle weakness, cramps, and atrophy, demographic patterns showing male predominance (2.7:1 ratio) with median onset at 40 years, and treatment approaches primarily involving intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this uncommon but treatable neurological condition.",
