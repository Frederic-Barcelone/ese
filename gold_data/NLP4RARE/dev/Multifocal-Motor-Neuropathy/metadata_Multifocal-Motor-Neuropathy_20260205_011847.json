  "short_description": "Clinical document describing multifocal motor neuropathy, a rare immune-mediated disorder causing progressive muscle weakness primarily in arms and legs.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of multifocal motor neuropathy, a rare acquired neurological disorder affecting approximately 0.6 per 100,000 individuals. The document details the pathophysiology of this immune-mediated condition, which involves inflammation and autoantibodies targeting specific proteins, leading to progressive muscle weakness, cramps, and atrophy. It covers epidemiological data showing a male predominance (2.7:1 ratio), typical onset around age 40, and the disorder's responsiveness to intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding the clinical presentation, demographics, and treatment approach for this uncommon but treatable neurological condition.",
