  "title": "Cat Eye Syndrome: A Rare Chromosomal Disorder",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Cat Eye Syndrome (CES), a rare chromosomal disorder caused by partial tetrasomy of chromosome 22 characterized by distinctive eye abnormalities and variable developmental malformations.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Cat Eye Syndrome (CES), a rare chromosomal disorder resulting from partial tetrasomy or trisomy of chromosome 22 (22pter-22q11). The syndrome is named for its characteristic ocular abnormality - a coloboma that creates an elongated pupil resembling a cat's eye, present in approximately half of affected individuals. The document details the genetic basis of the condition, explains the wide spectrum of clinical manifestations affecting multiple organ systems, and discusses the variable severity of symptoms even within families. It notes that while over 100 cases have been documented in medical literature since the syndrome's recognition over a century ago, the true incidence remains uncertain due to potential underdiagnosis of mild cases. The estimated prevalence ranges from 1 in 50,000 to 1 in 150,000 individuals based on data from Northeastern Switzerland.",
