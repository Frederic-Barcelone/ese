  "title": "Pseudocholinesterase Deficiency: Genetic Disorder Affecting Anesthetic Metabolism",
  "short_description": "A rare genetic disorder causing dangerous sensitivity to certain anesthetic agents due to enzyme deficiency, potentially leading to respiratory paralysis during surgery.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document describes pseudocholinesterase deficiency, an uncommon genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 1,500 to 2,500 people in the United States. The condition is characterized by a shortage or absence of the enzyme pseudocholinesterase in blood serum, making affected individuals extremely sensitive to choline-derived anesthetic agents such as succinylcholine and mivacurium. When exposed to these drugs during surgery, patients experience respiratory muscle paralysis and apnea, requiring mechanical ventilation until the anesthetic is metabolized. The document explains that individuals may remain unaware of their condition unless exposed to these specific anesthetics, and notes that the disorder disproportionately affects Caucasian American males. The text also provides definitions of various types of apnea to clarify the breathing complications associated with this condition.",
