  "long_description": "This clinical reference document outlines the comprehensive diagnostic framework for cystic fibrosis (CF), covering the standard diagnostic procedures used when CF is suspected based on newborn screening, characteristic symptoms, or family history. The document details the sweat test as the gold standard diagnostic method, describes FDA-approved genetic testing including the Tag-lt Cystic Fibrosis Kit, and explains the universal newborn screening program implemented across all 50 U.S. states using immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) assays followed by confirmatory testing.",
