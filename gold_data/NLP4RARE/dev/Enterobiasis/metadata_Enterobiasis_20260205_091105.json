  "short_description": "Clinical overview of enterobiasis, a common parasitic infection in children caused by pinworms, characterized by severe rectal itching.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of enterobiasis, also known as pinworm infection, which is identified as a common and highly contagious parasitic infestation that primarily affects children. The document explains the transmission mechanism through ingestion or inhalation of microscopic pinworm eggs and describes the clinical presentation, noting that while the infection rarely causes serious physical complications, it is characterized by its primary symptom of severe rectal itching. This appears to be an educational or reference material for healthcare professionals dealing with pediatric parasitic infections.",
