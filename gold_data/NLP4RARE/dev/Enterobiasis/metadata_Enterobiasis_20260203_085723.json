  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of enterobiasis, also known as pinworm infection, which represents one of the most common parasitic infestations affecting primarily pediatric populations. The document explains the transmission mechanism through ingestion or inhalation of microscopic pinworm eggs and describes the characteristic presentation of severe rectal itching as the primary symptom. While generally not causing serious physical complications, the condition's contagious nature and prevalence in children makes it an important topic for healthcare providers and parents to understand for proper diagnosis, treatment, and prevention strategies.",
