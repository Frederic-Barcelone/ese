  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of alkaptonuria, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder caused by mutations in the HGD gene. The condition is characterized by deficiency of the enzyme needed to break down homogentisic acid, leading to its accumulation in the body. The document details the clinical presentation including dark urine from infancy, ochronosis (bluish-black tissue discoloration), and progressive arthritis in adulthood. It covers the genetic basis, epidemiology, and demographic patterns of the disorder, noting its equal prevalence between sexes but more severe manifestation in males. The text also discusses the global distribution and estimated incidence rates, making it a valuable reference for healthcare professionals and researchers studying rare metabolic disorders.",
