  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy, an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting muscle tone and strength. The document details the clinical presentation, including congenital hypotonia (muscle floppiness) at birth, progressive muscle weakness during infancy and childhood that primarily affects the pelvis, neck, and shoulder muscles, and developmental milestone delays. The condition is notable for its non-progressive nature in adulthood, allowing most patients to achieve normal walking ability. The document explains the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with detailed genetic counseling information and notes that only nine cases have been documented in medical literature, with six cases occurring in a single family. Management recommendations for adults include maintaining adequate exercise and avoiding obesity.",
