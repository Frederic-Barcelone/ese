  "short_description": "Clinical documentation of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy, an extremely rare autosomal recessive muscle disorder characterized by congenital hypotonia and non-progressive symptoms in adulthood.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy, an extremely rare inherited muscle disorder affecting males and females equally. The document details the characteristic presentation of congenital hypotonia (muscle floppiness) at birth, slowly progressive symptoms during infancy and childhood, and stabilization in adulthood. It covers the clinical manifestations including delayed motor milestones, muscle weakness primarily affecting the pelvis, neck, and shoulder regions, and the tendency for affected toddlers to fall or stumble. The document explains the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with detailed genetic counseling information, noting that only nine cases have been reported in medical literature, with six cases occurring in a single family. Management recommendations for adults include adequate exercise and obesity prevention.",
