  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of Batten Turner Type Congenital Myopathy, an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder affecting muscle tone and strength. The document details the clinical presentation, including congenital hypotonia (muscle floppiness) at birth, progressive muscle weakness during infancy and childhood that stabilizes in adulthood, and characteristic involvement of pelvic, neck, and shoulder muscles. It explains the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with detailed genetic counseling information, noting that only nine cases have been documented in medical literature, with six cases occurring in a single family. The document also addresses long-term prognosis, management recommendations including exercise and weight management, and emphasizes that while symptoms are progressive in childhood, most affected individuals achieve normal walking ability as adults with only mild activity limitations.",
