  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Ewing sarcoma, a rare bone tumor primarily affecting adolescents, including its classification within the Ewing family of tumors.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Ewing sarcoma, a rare and aggressive bone tumor that predominantly occurs in adolescents. The document explains the relationship between Ewing sarcoma and related tumors such as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), which share the same chromosomal abnormality and are collectively classified as the Ewing family of tumors (EFT). It details the anatomical locations where these tumors typically develop, including long bones and flat bones of the pelvis and chest wall, as well as extraosseous presentations in soft tissue. The document emphasizes the aggressive nature of Ewing sarcoma and its potential for metastasis to lungs, other bones, and bone marrow, while noting that the exact cause remains unknown.",
