Ewing sarcoma is related to another type of tumor known as primitive neuroectodermal tumor (PNET). Researchers have learned that these tumors are associated with the same chromosomal abnormality (balanced reciprocal translocation) and share many physiological characteristics. Consequently, these tumors are sometimes collectively classified as the Ewing family of tumors (EFT).

This general term encompasses Ewing sarcoma of bone, extraosseous Ewing sarcoma, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and Askin’s tumor (a tumor of the chest wall). Ewing sarcoma of bone accounts for approximately 70 percent of the tumors in this family. Generally, the term Ewing sarcoma is preferred because, despite the different names, it is one tumor, molecularly. Ewing sarcoma of bone most often",
