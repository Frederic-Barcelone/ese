  "short_description": "Clinical overview of hereditary ataxias, including prevalence, demographics, and ethnic variations in specific ataxia subtypes.",
  "long_description": "This document provides information about hereditary ataxias, neurological disorders that affect both males and females equally. It discusses the estimated prevalence of 150,000 affected individuals or those at risk in the United States. The document highlights the variation in onset timing among different forms of hereditary ataxia and emphasizes ethnic predispositions for specific subtypes, including SCA3 in Portuguese populations, SCA10 in Mexican populations, and DRPLA in Japanese populations. This information is valuable for understanding the epidemiological patterns and genetic diversity of autosomal dominant hereditary ataxias.",
