  "short_description": "Clinical overview of hereditary ataxias, including prevalence, demographics, and ethnic variations in specific ataxia subtypes.",
  "long_description": "This document provides information about hereditary ataxias, neurological disorders that affect both males and females equally. It discusses the epidemiology of these conditions, noting that approximately 150,000 people in the United States are affected by or at risk for hereditary ataxia. The document highlights the variation in age of onset among different forms of hereditary ataxia and emphasizes ethnic predispositions for specific subtypes, including the higher prevalence of SCA3 in Portuguese populations, SCA10 in Mexican populations, and DRPLA in Japanese populations.",
