  "short_description": "Clinical overview of berylliosis, a form of metal poisoning caused by occupational exposure to beryllium through inhalation or skin contact.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of berylliosis, a serious occupational health condition resulting from exposure to beryllium, a metallic element widely used in electronics, high-technology ceramics, metals extraction, and dental alloy preparation. The document explains that berylliosis occurs primarily through inhalation of beryllium dusts and vapors or through skin implantation of the substance, with toxic effects most commonly arising from workplace exposure. This information is essential for healthcare professionals, occupational health specialists, and workers in industries where beryllium exposure is a risk.",
