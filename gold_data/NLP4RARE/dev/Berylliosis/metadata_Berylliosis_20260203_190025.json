  "short_description": "Clinical overview of berylliosis, a form of metal poisoning caused by occupational exposure to beryllium through inhalation or skin contact.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of berylliosis, a serious occupational health condition resulting from exposure to beryllium, a metallic element widely used in electronics, high-technology ceramics, metals extraction, and dental alloy preparation. The document explains that berylliosis occurs primarily through inhalation of beryllium dusts, vapors, or compounds, or through implantation of the substance in the skin. The toxic effects are most commonly associated with workplace exposure, making this an important occupational health concern for workers in industries that utilize beryllium-containing materials.",
