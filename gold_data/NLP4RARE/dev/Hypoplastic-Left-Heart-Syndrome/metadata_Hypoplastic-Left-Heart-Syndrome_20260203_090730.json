  "title": "Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approach",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a rare congenital heart defect affecting cardiac chamber development, with diagnostic methods and epidemiological data.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of hypoplastic left heart syndrome, a group of rare congenital heart defects characterized by underdevelopment of the left side of the heart. The document explains normal cardiac anatomy and function, detailing the four-chamber structure and blood flow pathways, before describing how this syndrome disrupts normal cardiac development. It includes important epidemiological information, noting the condition affects approximately 1 in 100,000 live births with a male predominance (67%), and accounts for 7-9% of all congenital heart defects. The document outlines the diagnostic approach, emphasizing that symptoms are present at birth and diagnosis is confirmed through clinical evaluation, characteristic findings identification, and specialized testing including chest X-rays and echocardiography.",
