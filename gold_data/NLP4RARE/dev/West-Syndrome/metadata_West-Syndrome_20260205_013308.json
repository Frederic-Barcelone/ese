  "short_description": "Clinical document describing West syndrome, a constellation of symptoms including epileptic/infantile spasms, hypsarrhythmia, and intellectual disability.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of West syndrome, a serious neurological condition characterized by three key features: epileptic/infantile spasms, abnormal brain wave patterns called hypsarrhythmia, and intellectual disability. The document explains the varying severity of spasms, from violent jackknife movements to mild twitching, and discusses the typical onset in early infancy. It covers the updated terminology from the International League Against Epilepsy (ILAE), which now prefers 'epileptic spasms' to encompass different age groups. The document also addresses the classification system, distinguishing between symptomatic epileptic spasms (when a specific cause is identified) and cryptogenic epileptic spasms (when the cause cannot be determined).",
