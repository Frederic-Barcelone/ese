  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Alpers disease, a rare progressive neurologic disorder affecting children with symptoms including seizures, spasticity, cognitive decline, and often liver complications.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Alpers disease, a rare progressive neurologic disorder that typically manifests in early childhood between 3 months and 5 years of age. The condition is characterized by a complex constellation of neurological symptoms including seizures, spasticity with exaggerated reflexes, loss of motor coordination, partial paralysis, and muscle twitching. Patients often present with hypotonia despite limb stiffness, and MRI findings reveal increased grey matter density. The disease frequently involves serious liver complications ranging from jaundice to complete liver failure and cirrhosis. Progressive cognitive decline and dementia are common features, with severe mental retardation developing over time. In advanced stages, patients may develop spastic quadriplegia and blindness due to optic nerve degeneration. The document notes that while the disorder affects males and females equally, diagnostic challenges make accurate prevalence estimates difficult, with the condition estimated to affect fewer than 1 in 200,000 individuals.",
