  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), a rare brain tumor representing 4% of all brain malignancies with approximately 1,500 new cases annually in the United States. The content examines the demographic distribution showing slight male predominance and details the primary risk factors for PCNSL development. Particular emphasis is placed on immunosuppression as the leading risk factor, including HIV/AIDS patients with high viral loads and low CD4+ counts, organ transplant recipients, and individuals with congenital immunodeficiency syndromes. The document also addresses age-related risk patterns, noting that immunocompetent patients are typically diagnosed around age 60, while AIDS-related cases commonly occur in the fifth decade of life.",
