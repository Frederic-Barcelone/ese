  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive epidemiological analysis of primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), a rare brain tumor representing 4% of all brain malignancies with approximately 1,500 new cases annually in the United States. The content details the demographic patterns showing slight male predominance and examines the two primary risk factors: immunosuppression and age. It specifically addresses high-risk populations including HIV/AIDS patients with high viral loads and low CD4+ counts, organ transplant recipients, and individuals with congenital immunodeficiency syndromes. The document also discusses age-related patterns, noting that immunocompetent patients are typically diagnosed around age 60, while AIDS-related cases commonly occur in the fifth decade of life.",
