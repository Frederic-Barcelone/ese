  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Chromosome 14 Ring, an extremely rare chromosomal disorder affecting the 14th chromosome. The condition is characterized by psychomotor delays, intellectual disability, growth retardation, and seizures in affected infants and children. The disorder presents with distinctive craniofacial features including microcephaly, elongated face, ocular hypertelorism, thin upper lip, flat nasal bridge with prominent tip, and large low-set ears. With over 40 cases reported in medical literature and a slight male predominance, the document emphasizes the importance of chromosomal testing for accurate diagnosis and differentiation from similar chromosomal disorders.",
