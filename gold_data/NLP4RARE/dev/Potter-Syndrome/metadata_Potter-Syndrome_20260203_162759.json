  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological data on Potter syndrome, a rare congenital disorder. It details the estimated incidence rates ranging from 1 in 4,000 to 10,000 births, discusses bilateral renal agenesis as the primary cause affecting approximately 1 in 5,000 fetuses and representing 20% of cases, and notes the higher prevalence in male newborns due to increased occurrence of obstructive uropathy in males. The document emphasizes the rarity of the condition and acknowledges gaps in current epidemiological knowledge.",
