  "short_description": "Clinical document describing hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by elevated ferritin levels and cataracts.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder affecting approximately 1 in 200,000 people. The document details the epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approach for this condition, which was first described in medical literature in 1995. It explains that the syndrome affects males and females equally, with over 100 families documented in medical literature. The document emphasizes the diagnostic challenges due to the rarity of the condition and outlines the key diagnostic criteria including characteristic symptoms such as cataracts, elevated plasma ferritin levels, and the importance of comprehensive clinical evaluation and specialized testing for accurate diagnosis.",
