  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of tinnitus epidemiology and clinical characteristics. It details that tinnitus affects approximately 10% of the general population equally across genders and all age groups, including children. The document distinguishes between rhythmic tinnitus (accounting for only 1% of cases) and the more common non-rhythmic form. Special attention is given to rhythmic tinnitus associated with pseudotumor and sinus wall anomalies, which predominantly affects overweight women between their third and sixth decades of life. The document also addresses the variable onset patterns of tinnitus, which can present either abruptly or develop gradually over time.",
