  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of tinnitus, detailing its epidemiological characteristics and demographic distribution. It covers the general prevalence of tinnitus affecting approximately 10% of the population equally across genders and age groups, while distinguishing between common non-rhythmic tinnitus and the rarer rhythmic variant that accounts for only 1% of cases. The document specifically addresses rhythmic tinnitus associated with pseudotumor and sinus wall anomalies, noting its predominance in overweight women aged 30-60 years, and discusses the variable onset patterns of the condition.",
