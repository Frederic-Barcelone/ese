  "short_description": "Clinical document describing arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), their pathophysiology, demographics, and epidemiological characteristics in the central nervous system.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), focusing on brain and central nervous system lesions. The document explains the pathophysiology of AVMs as abnormal direct connections between arterial and venous circulations without normal capillary beds, resulting in high-flow, low-resistance vascular tangles. It covers the presumed congenital nature of AVMs, their age distribution with peak detection in the mid-30s, hemodynamic consequences, genetic factors including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and associated syndromes. The document presents epidemiological data showing equal gender distribution, detection rates of 1 per 100,000 population annually, and prevalence estimates of approximately 30,000 affected individuals in the United States.",
