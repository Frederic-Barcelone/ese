  "short_description": "Clinical document describing arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), their pathophysiology, demographics, and epidemiological characteristics.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), focusing on brain AVMs and their characteristics. The document explains the pathophysiology of AVMs as direct connections between arterial and venous circulations without normal capillary beds, resulting in high-flow, low-resistance vascular lesions. It covers the presumed congenital nature of AVMs, their age distribution with peak detection in the mid-30s, and the hemodynamic consequences of abnormal arteriovenous connections. The document also addresses epidemiological aspects including prevalence rates (10 per 100,000 population), incidence of new cases (1 per 100,000 per year), genetic factors including hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, and associated syndromes. Equal gender distribution and lack of ethnic predisposition are noted, along with the peak symptom onset occurring between ages 35-40 years.",
