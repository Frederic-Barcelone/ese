  "short_description": "Clinical document describing arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), their pathophysiology, demographics, and epidemiological characteristics in the central nervous system.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), focusing on brain and central nervous system manifestations. The document explains the pathophysiology of AVMs as direct arterial-venous connections without normal capillary beds, resulting in high-flow, low-resistance vascular lesions. It covers the clinical presentation patterns, with peak symptom onset in the mid-30s to 40s, epidemiological data showing equal gender distribution and prevalence of approximately 10 per 100,000 population, and genetic factors including rare familial inheritance patterns. The document also discusses the hemodynamic consequences of AVMs, their potential congenital versus acquired nature, and associated syndromes, providing essential clinical information for healthcare professionals managing patients with these vascular malformations.",
