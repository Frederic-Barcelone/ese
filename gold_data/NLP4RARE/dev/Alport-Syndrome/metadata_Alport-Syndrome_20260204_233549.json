  "short_description": "Document providing epidemiological data on Alport syndrome prevalence and its impact on kidney disease in the United States.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document presents key epidemiological statistics about Alport syndrome, a genetic kidney disorder affecting approximately 30,000-60,000 people in the United States. The document outlines the condition's prevalence in the general population (1 in 5,000-10,000 people) and its contribution to chronic kidney disease, accounting for 3% of pediatric cases and 0.2% of adult end-stage renal disease cases. It also discusses the differential severity patterns between X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS), where males are more severely affected than females, and autosomal forms where both sexes are equally affected.",
