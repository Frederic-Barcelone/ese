  "short_description": "Document presenting epidemiological data on Alport syndrome prevalence and its impact on kidney disease in the United States population.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides comprehensive epidemiological information about Alport syndrome, a genetic kidney disorder affecting approximately 30,000-60,000 people in the United States. The document details prevalence rates, demographic distribution, and the syndrome's contribution to chronic kidney disease in both pediatric and adult populations. It distinguishes between X-linked Alport syndrome (XLAS), which shows sex-linked severity differences with males more severely affected than females, and autosomal forms where both sexes are equally affected. The document serves as a reference for understanding the population burden and clinical significance of this hereditary nephritis condition.",
