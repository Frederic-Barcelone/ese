  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Dejerine-Sottas syndrome (DSS), a hereditary neurological disorder that affects both motor and sensory functions. The text details the typical onset by age two with initial symptoms of tingling, prickling, or burning sensations, followed by progressive muscle weakness beginning in the legs and potentially spreading to hands and forearms. The document outlines the full spectrum of clinical manifestations including delayed motor milestones, potential wheelchair dependency in teenage years, respiratory insufficiency, vision difficulties, pain, loss of heat sensitivity, absent reflexes, muscle atrophy, scoliosis, and ataxia. It emphasizes the variable presentation among individuals and notes that the condition affects all demographics equally regardless of sex, race, or ethnicity.",
