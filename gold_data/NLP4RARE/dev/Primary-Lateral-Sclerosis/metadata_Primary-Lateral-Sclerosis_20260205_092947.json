  "short_description": "Clinical document describing primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare neuromuscular disorder affecting central motor neurons and causing progressive muscle weakness and stiffness.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare motor neuron disease that primarily affects adults during midlife. The document details the pathophysiology involving central motor neuron dysfunction, clinical presentation characterized by progressive painless weakness and stiffness beginning in the legs and potentially progressing to arms and bulbar muscles, epidemiological factors including equal gender distribution and typical onset in the fifth decade of life, and current treatment approaches. The content emphasizes that PLS is part of the broader category of motor neuron diseases, occurs sporadically in most cases with unknown etiology, and requires symptomatic management including medications for spasticity and muscle cramps, along with supportive therapies such as physical and speech therapy.",
