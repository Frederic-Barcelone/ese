  "short_description": "Clinical document describing primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare neuromuscular disorder affecting central motor neurons and causing progressive muscle weakness and stiffness.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare motor neuron disease that primarily affects adults in midlife. The document details the pathophysiology of PLS, which involves dysfunction of central motor neurons leading to progressive, painless weakness and stiffness beginning in the legs and potentially progressing to the arms and bulbar muscles. It covers the epidemiology, noting equal prevalence between males and females with typical onset in the fifth decade of life, though rare familial forms affecting children have been reported. The document outlines current treatment approaches, which are primarily symptomatic and supportive, including medications for spasticity management (baclofen, tizanidine), muscle cramps (quinine), and muscle contractions (diazepam), along with physical and speech therapy interventions.",
