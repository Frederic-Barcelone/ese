  "short_description": "Clinical document describing primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare neuromuscular disorder affecting central motor neurons and causing progressive muscle weakness and stiffness.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness primarily affecting leg muscles, with potential progression to arms and bulbar muscles. The document covers the disorder's unknown etiology, sporadic occurrence pattern, equal gender distribution, typical onset during the fifth decade of life, and rare familial forms affecting children. It details the pathophysiology involving central motor neuron dysfunction and outlines current treatment approaches including pharmacological interventions (baclofen, tizanidine, quinine, diazepam) and supportive therapies such as physical and speech therapy for symptom management.",
