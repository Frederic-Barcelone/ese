  "short_description": "Clinical document describing primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare neuromuscular disorder affecting central motor neurons and causing progressive muscle weakness and stiffness.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of primary lateral sclerosis (PLS), a rare motor neuron disease characterized by progressive weakness and stiffness primarily affecting leg muscles, with potential progression to arms and bulbar muscles. The document covers the disorder's unknown etiology, sporadic occurrence pattern, equal gender distribution, typical onset during the fifth decade of life, and rare familial forms affecting children. It outlines current treatment approaches including pharmacological interventions (baclofen, tizanidine, quinine, diazepam) for symptom management, physical therapy for joint mobility, and speech therapy for bulbar involvement, emphasizing the symptomatic and supportive nature of available treatments.",
