  "title": "Waldenström's Macroglobulinemia: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Characteristics",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Waldenström's macroglobulinemia, a rare lymphoma characterized by excessive IgM antibody production causing blood hyperviscosity and various systemic symptoms.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Waldenström's macroglobulinemia (WMG), a rare malignant disorder affecting bone marrow and lymphatic tissues. The document details the pathophysiology involving abnormal B lymphocyte accumulation and excessive IgM antibody production leading to blood hyperviscosity. It covers the gradual onset of symptoms including fatigue, anemia, bleeding complications, peripheral neuropathy, and vision problems. The text discusses epidemiological data showing the disorder affects approximately 1 in 3.4 million American men with a median diagnosis age of 67, while being less common in people of African descent. Diagnostic approaches including complete blood count analysis and serum electrophoresis are outlined, along with typical clinical presentations involving organomegaly and retinal bleeding.",
