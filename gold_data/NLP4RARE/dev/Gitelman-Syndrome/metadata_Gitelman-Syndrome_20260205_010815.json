  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the epidemiological characteristics and population frequency of Gitelman syndrome, a genetic disorder affecting salt regulation.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on Gitelman syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that affects kidney salt handling. The document details that the condition affects males and females equally with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 40,000 Caucasian individuals, though actual rates may be higher due to underdiagnosis. It also discusses the carrier frequency of approximately 1% in European populations and notes that heterozygous carriers may experience beneficial effects including lower blood pressure due to mild salt wasting. The document highlights challenges in determining accurate prevalence due to diagnostic difficulties.",
