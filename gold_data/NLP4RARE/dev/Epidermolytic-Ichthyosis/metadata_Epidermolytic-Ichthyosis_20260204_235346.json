  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI), a rare genetic skin condition affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals. The text details the progression of symptoms from birth, where infants present with red, blistering, and denuded skin, to the gradual development of characteristic scaling patterns and skin thickening over time. The document covers the spectrum of clinical presentations, from severe cases with generalized erythroderma and palmoplantar keratoderma that may require surgical intervention, to milder forms with minimal friction-related blistering. It also discusses complications such as bacterial skin infections and heat intolerance, and mentions the rare variant ichthyosis hystrix (Curth-Macklin). The diagnostic approach combining clinical assessment with molecular genetic testing for KRT1 and KRT10 gene mutations is outlined.",
