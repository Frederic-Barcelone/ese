  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of epidermolytic ichthyosis (EI), a rare genetic skin condition affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals. The text details the progression of symptoms from birth through adulthood, including initial presentation with red, blistering, and denuded skin that evolves into characteristic scaling patterns and skin thickening. The document covers the spectrum of clinical manifestations, from severe cases requiring surgical intervention due to palmoplantar keratoderma limiting mobility, to milder presentations with minimal friction-related blistering. It also addresses complications such as bacterial infections and heat intolerance, describes the rare ichthyosis hystrix variant, and outlines diagnostic approaches including physical examination and molecular genetic testing for KRT1 and KRT10 gene mutations.",
