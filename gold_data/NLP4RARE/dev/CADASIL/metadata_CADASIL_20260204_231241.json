  "title": "CADASIL: Rare Genetic Disorder Affecting Brain Blood Vessels",
  "short_description": "Overview of CADASIL, a rare genetic disorder that affects small blood vessels in the brain with variable symptoms and progression.",
  "long_description": "This document provides an introduction to CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy), a rare genetic disorder first identified in 1993 that affects the small blood vessels in the brain. The document explains that CADASIL affects both males and females equally across all races worldwide, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 2-5 per 100,000 people. It emphasizes the significant variability in age of onset, severity, symptoms, and disease progression, even among family members with the same genetic condition. The document also notes that CADASIL is frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it challenging to determine its true prevalence in the general population.",
