  "title": "Jejunal Atresia: Rare Genetic Disorder of Small Intestine Development",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of jejunal atresia, a rare genetic disorder causing partial absence of stomach membrane fold and intestinal blockage.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of jejunal atresia, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the partial absence of the stomach membrane fold that connects the small intestine to the abdominal wall. The condition results in the jejunal portion of the small intestine twisting around the marginal artery, causing intestinal blockage (atresia). The document details the clinical presentation including vomiting, abdominal distension, and constipation, explains the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern with associated genetic risks for carriers and offspring, and notes the extreme rarity of the condition with only approximately 57 cases reported in medical literature. The text serves as an educational resource for understanding the pathophysiology, genetics, and epidemiology of this rare congenital anomaly.",
