  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), an extremely rare spongiform encephalopathy that causes rapid brain degeneration. The text details the characteristic symptom progression from initial neurological manifestations including confusion, depression, and behavioral changes, to advanced stages featuring severe cognitive deterioration, neuromuscular abnormalities such as myoclonus and athetosis, and ultimately life-threatening complications. The document emphasizes the rapid progression of the disease, with many patients developing fatal complications within less than a year of symptom onset, making it a critical reference for understanding this devastating neurological condition.",
