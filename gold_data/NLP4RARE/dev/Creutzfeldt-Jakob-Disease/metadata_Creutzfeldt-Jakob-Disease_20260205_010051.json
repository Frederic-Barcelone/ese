  "short_description": "Clinical documentation describing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare degenerative brain disorder characterized by rapidly progressive neurological symptoms and poor prognosis.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), an extremely rare spongiform encephalopathy that causes rapid neurological deterioration. The document details the characteristic symptom progression from initial manifestations including confusion, depression, behavioral changes, and coordination problems, to advanced stages featuring severe dementia, neuromuscular abnormalities such as myoclonus and athetosis, and ultimately life-threatening complications. The text emphasizes the aggressive nature of the disease, noting that many patients develop fatal complications within less than a year of symptom onset, making this a critical reference for understanding the clinical presentation and prognosis of this devastating neurological condition.",
