  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, a rare degenerative brain disorder characterized by rapidly progressive neurological symptoms and poor prognosis.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD), an extremely rare spongiform encephalopathy that causes rapid neurological deterioration. The text details the characteristic symptom progression from initial manifestations including confusion, depression, behavioral changes, and coordination problems, to advanced stages featuring severe dementia, neuromuscular abnormalities such as myoclonus and athetosis, and ultimately coma and life-threatening complications. The document emphasizes the aggressive nature of the disease, with many patients developing fatal complications within less than a year of symptom onset, making it a critical reference for understanding this devastating neurological condition.",
