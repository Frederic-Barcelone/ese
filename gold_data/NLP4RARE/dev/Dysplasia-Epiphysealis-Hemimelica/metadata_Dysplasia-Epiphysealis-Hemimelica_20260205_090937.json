  "short_description": "Clinical overview of dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (DEH), a rare developmental bone disease affecting cartilage growth in children's epiphyses.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (DEH), also known as Trevor's disease, a rare developmental bone disorder affecting children. The text covers the disease's characteristics, including abnormal cartilage growth from the epiphyses of long bones, particularly in the lower limbs affecting knee, ankle, and tarsal bones. It details the three forms of the condition (localized, classical, and generalized), epidemiological data showing predominance in males aged 1-15 years, and historical context from its first description in 1926 to Trevor's recognition in 1950. The document emphasizes the benign nature of the condition, unknown etiology, estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000,000, and potential for misdiagnosis.",
