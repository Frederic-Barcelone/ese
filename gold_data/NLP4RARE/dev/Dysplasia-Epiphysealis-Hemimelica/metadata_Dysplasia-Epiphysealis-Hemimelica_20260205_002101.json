  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of dysplasia epiphysealis hemimelica (DEH), also known as Trevor's disease, a rare developmental bone disorder affecting children. The condition is characterized by abnormal cartilage growth arising from the epiphyses of long bones, particularly in the lower limbs including knee, ankle, and tarsal bones. The document covers the historical background of the disease, first described in 1926 and recognized by Trevor in 1950, its clinical presentation in three forms (localized, classical, and generalized), epidemiology showing a male predominance and estimated incidence of 1 in 1,000,000, and notes that while the exact cause remains unknown, the condition is benign with no reports of malignant transformation. The text emphasizes the rarity of the condition and limited clinical experience, with most diagnoses occurring before age 8.",
