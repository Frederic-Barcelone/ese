  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Schindler disease, a rare lysosomal storage disorder caused by alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase deficiency with multiple clinical subtypes.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Schindler disease, a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by deficient activity of the lysosomal enzyme alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (alpha-NAGA). The condition leads to abnormal accumulation of complex compounds including glycosphingolipids, glycoproteins, and oligosaccharides in body tissues and urine. The document describes the three recognized forms of the disease: severe infantile-onset type I, milder adult-onset type II, and intermediate type III. It covers the genetic basis involving NAGA gene mutations with autosomal recessive inheritance, epidemiological data showing equal gender distribution, and the challenges in determining true disease frequency due to potential misdiagnosis. The document also contextualizes Schindler disease within the broader category of lysosomal storage diseases and notes its first description in medical literature during the late 1980s.",
