  "short_description": "Clinical document discussing the unknown incidence and prevalence of tarsal tunnel syndrome, noting equal gender distribution.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about tarsal tunnel syndrome, a peripheral nerve entrapment condition. The document acknowledges the current limitations in understanding the true incidence and prevalence rates of this disorder within the general population. It notes that available evidence suggests tarsal tunnel syndrome affects both males and females equally, indicating no significant gender predisposition for this condition. This information is relevant for healthcare providers and researchers working in the fields of neurology, orthopedics, and podiatry.",
