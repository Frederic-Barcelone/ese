  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological data and clinical characteristics of mixed cryoglobulinemia, a rare hematological disorder with unknown exact prevalence in the general population. The content details geographic variations in incidence among HCV-infected patients, with lower rates in Northern Europe and North America (less than 1%) compared to Southern Europe (2-5%). The document highlights key demographic patterns, including peak occurrence in individuals aged 40-60 years, a 3:1 female predominance, and the strong association with hepatitis C virus infection in approximately 90% of cases.",
