  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides an overview of Fetal Valproate Syndrome (FVS), detailing the significant teratogenic risks associated with valproic acid (VPA) use during pregnancy. The document highlights that FVS affects both sexes equally and presents compelling evidence of a 20-fold increase in various congenital abnormalities when VPA is used during the first trimester compared to pregnancies without antiepileptic drug exposure. The comprehensive risk profile includes neural tube defects, orofacial clefts, cardiovascular malformations, genitourinary defects, developmental delays, endocrine disorders, limb abnormalities, and autism spectrum disorders.",
