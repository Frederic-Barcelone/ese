  "short_description": "Clinical document discussing the population prevalence, incidence rates, and demographic distribution of Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document examines the epidemiological aspects of Cardiofaciocutaneous (CFC) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder associated with BRAF mutations. The document presents data on population prevalence, citing a Japanese study that reported an incidence rate of approximately 1 in 810,000. It discusses the equal distribution between males and females, the global distribution of reported cases across all continents, and notes that nearly 400 cases have been documented in medical literature. The document acknowledges that the actual prevalence may be higher due to potential underdiagnosis of mildly affected adults, suggesting the worldwide total exceeds current estimates.",
