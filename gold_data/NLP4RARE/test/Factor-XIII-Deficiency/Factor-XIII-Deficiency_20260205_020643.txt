Factor XIll deficiency affects males and females in equal numbers. Symptoms can become apparent at any age. Individuals of any race or ethnicity can be affected. The incidence of factor XIII deficiency has been estimated to be between 1 in 2,000,000-5,000,000 people in the general population. However, factor XIII deficiency can go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the disorder’s true frequency. Most researchers believe that the disorder is under-diagnosed. The incidence of factor XIII deficiency tends to be higher in countries where marriage to close relatives (consanguineous marriage) is more common.
