  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Factor XIII deficiency, a rare bleeding disorder that affects both males and females equally across all age groups and ethnicities. The text discusses the estimated incidence rate of 1 in 2-5 million people in the general population, while highlighting significant diagnostic challenges that lead to under-reporting of cases. The document emphasizes that the true frequency of this coagulation disorder is likely higher than reported due to frequent misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis, and notes increased prevalence in populations with higher rates of consanguineous marriages.",
