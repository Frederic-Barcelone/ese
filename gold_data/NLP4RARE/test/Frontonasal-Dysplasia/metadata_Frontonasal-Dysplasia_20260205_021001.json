  "short_description": "A clinical overview of frontonasal dysplasia, a rare congenital disorder affecting facial development with equal prevalence in males and females.",
  "long_description": "This document provides essential clinical information about frontonasal dysplasia, a very rare congenital disorder that affects facial and cranial development. The text outlines the epidemiological characteristics of the condition, noting its equal prevalence between males and females and the limited number of documented cases in scientific literature (at least 100 reported cases). The document details the diagnostic approach, which typically occurs during the neonatal period and involves comprehensive clinical evaluation, specialized imaging studies including x-ray examinations, and identification of characteristic physical features. It also notes that genetic testing is currently available only on a research basis, highlighting the ongoing investigational nature of molecular diagnostics for this rare condition.",
