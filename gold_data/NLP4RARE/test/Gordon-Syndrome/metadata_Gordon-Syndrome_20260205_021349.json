The syndrome is characterized by distinctive physical features that are typically present and recognizable at birth, including camptodactyly (permanent flexion of fingers), clubfoot, and cleft palate. The document discusses the diagnostic approach, which relies on thorough clinical evaluation and identification of characteristic physical findings. With more than 40 documented cases across five families reported in medical literature, this resource serves as a reference for understanding the congenital nature and clinical presentation of Gordon syndrome.",
