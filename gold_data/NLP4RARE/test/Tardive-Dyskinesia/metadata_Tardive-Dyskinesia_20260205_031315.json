  "title": "Tardive Dyskinesia: Clinical Overview and Drug-Induced Movement Disorder",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing tardive dyskinesia, a movement disorder characterized by involuntary facial and body movements caused by long-term neuroleptic drug use.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of tardive dyskinesia (TD), a serious neurological side effect resulting from prolonged use of neuroleptic medications. The document details the characteristic symptoms including involuntary movements of facial muscles, jaw, lips, and tongue, as well as potential involvement of limbs through choreic or athetotic movements. It explains the underlying mechanism involving dopamine receptor blockade and identifies high-risk populations, particularly patients with schizophrenia on long-term neuroleptic therapy. The document also covers various neuroleptic medications that can cause TD, including those prescribed for mental health conditions, neurological disorders, and gastrointestinal issues such as metoclopramide and prochlorperazine.",
