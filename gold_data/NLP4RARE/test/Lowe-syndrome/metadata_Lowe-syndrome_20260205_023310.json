  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Lowe syndrome, a rare X-linked genetic disorder affecting primarily males with global prevalence data.",
  "long_description": "This document provides essential clinical information about Lowe syndrome, a rare genetic disorder with an estimated prevalence of 1-10 per 1,000,000 males. The condition demonstrates a clear male predominance due to its genetic inheritance pattern and has been documented across multiple continents including North and South America, Europe, Japan, and India. This overview serves as a foundational reference for understanding the epidemiological characteristics and global distribution of this uncommon genetic condition.",
