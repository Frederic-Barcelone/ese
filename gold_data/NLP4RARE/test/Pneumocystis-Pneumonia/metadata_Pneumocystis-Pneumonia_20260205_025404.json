  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the symptoms, risk factors, and diagnostic methods for Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP), particularly in immunocompromised patients.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PJP), a serious opportunistic infection that primarily affects immunocompromised individuals. The document details the characteristic clinical presentation including gradual onset dyspnea, dry cough, fever, night sweats, and weight loss, distinguishing it from typical bacterial pneumonia. It identifies high-risk populations including HIV patients with CD4 counts below 200 cells/mm³, organ transplant recipients, cancer patients on immunosuppressive therapy, and individuals with inflammatory conditions. The document outlines the diagnostic approach requiring chest X-rays, bronchoalveolar lavage for sputum sampling, PCR testing for DNA amplification, and β-D-glucan blood tests for confirmation.",
