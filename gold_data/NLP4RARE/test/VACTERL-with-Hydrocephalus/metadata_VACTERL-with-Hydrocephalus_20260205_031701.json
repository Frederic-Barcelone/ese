  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of VACTERL association with hydrocephalus, an extremely rare genetic disorder that combines the multisystem features of VACTERL association with hydrocephalus. VACTERL is an acronym representing common findings in affected children, and this variant affects males and females equally. The document discusses the rarity of the condition, noting that exact prevalence in the general population is unknown, and outlines diagnostic approaches including comprehensive physical examination and specialized testing to identify major and minor features of the association alongside hydrocephalus.",
