  "short_description": "Clinical document describing amniotic band syndrome, a condition causing various birth defects with unknown and controversial causes.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of amniotic band syndrome, a well-recognized condition associated with various birth defects that occur after normal early fetal development. The document details the variable severity of the condition, ranging from isolated findings to multiple disfiguring complications, with the arms and legs being most commonly affected, though the head, face, and internal organs may also be involved. The text explores the controversial and unknown etiology of the syndrome, presenting two main theoretical frameworks: the intrinsic theory (internal fetal causes) and the extrinsic theory (external environmental causes), while acknowledging that both factors may contribute and that causation may vary between individual cases.",
