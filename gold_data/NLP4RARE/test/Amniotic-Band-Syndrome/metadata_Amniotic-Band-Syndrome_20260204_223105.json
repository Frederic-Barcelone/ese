  "short_description": "Clinical document describing amniotic band syndrome, a congenital condition causing various birth defects with unknown and controversial etiology.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of amniotic band syndrome, a well-recognized congenital condition that can result in a wide spectrum of birth defects ranging from isolated findings to severe, multiple complications. The document explains that abnormalities develop after normal early fetal development, most commonly affecting the extremities (arms and legs), but also potentially involving the head, face, and internal organs. The text discusses the controversial and unknown exact etiology of the condition, presenting two main theoretical frameworks: the intrinsic theory (internal fetal factors) and the extrinsic theory (external factors acting on the fetus). The document suggests that both mechanisms may contribute to the syndrome and that causative factors may vary between individual cases.",
