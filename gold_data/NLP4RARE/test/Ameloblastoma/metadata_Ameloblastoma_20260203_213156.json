  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of ameloblastoma, a rare jaw disorder characterized by abnormal tissue growth that typically results in benign tumors or cysts. The document covers the pathological nature of the condition, noting that while usually benign, the tissue growth can be locally aggressive and may involve surrounding areas such as sinuses and eye sockets. It discusses the potential causes, including jaw injury, dental infections, viral infections, and nutritional deficiencies, while acknowledging that the exact etiology remains unclear. The document also addresses the demographic distribution, noting equal prevalence across genders and ethnic groups, and mentions diagnostic imaging methods including X-ray and MRI studies.",
