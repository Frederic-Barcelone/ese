  "short_description": "Clinical overview of keratoconus, a progressive eye disorder characterized by corneal thinning and cone-shaped bulging that causes vision problems in teenagers and young adults.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of keratoconus, an ocular disorder that involves progressive thinning and structural changes of the cornea. The condition transforms the normally dome-shaped cornea into a cone-shaped bulge, particularly in areas of greatest thinning. The document details the clinical presentation including blurry or distorted vision, photophobia, and other vision complications. It explains the typical onset during puberty and prevalence in teenagers and young adults, discusses the multifactorial etiology involving genetic and environmental factors, and outlines treatment approaches ranging from corrective lenses to surgical intervention in severe cases.",
