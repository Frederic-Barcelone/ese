  "short_description": "Clinical document describing myotonia congenita, a rare genetic disorder affecting skeletal muscle fiber membranes causing muscle stiffness and delayed relaxation.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of myotonia congenita, a rare genetic disorder characterized by abnormalities in voluntary skeletal muscle fiber membranes. The document explains how these membrane abnormalities lead to hyperexcitability and result in the hallmark symptom of myotonia - difficulty relaxing muscles after contraction. It details associated symptoms including muscle stiffness and rigidity, particularly when attempting movement after periods of rest. The document also describes the characteristic muscle hypertrophy that often accompanies this condition, giving affected individuals a distinctive 'herculean' or bodybuilder-like physical appearance.",
