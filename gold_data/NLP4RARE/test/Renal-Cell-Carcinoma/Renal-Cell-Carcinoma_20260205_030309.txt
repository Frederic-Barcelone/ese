Renal cell carcinoma is a form of kidney cancer. Some patients with renal cell carcinoma do not have symptoms (asymptomatic). When symptoms are present, they may include blood in the urine; urine that is brown or rusty-colored; abdominal pain; weight loss; enlargement of one testicle or varicose veins of the testis (varicocele) in a male patient; fever; a thin, malnourished appearance; vision abnormalities; and elevated blood pressure. The most common feature of the syndrome is the passing of blood in the urine (hematuria). Renal cell carcinoma is more common in males than in females (ratio of 2 or 3 to 1) and in persons with a history of smoking. It is also more common in persons with other types of kidney disorders and tends to run in some families. Renal cell carcinoma accounts for approximately 30,000 new cases of kidney malignancies per year in the United States. Imaging studies, typically computerized tomography (CT) and abdominal ultrasonography (USG), are used in the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma. Blood and urine testing may also be helpful.
