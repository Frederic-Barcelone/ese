  "short_description": "Clinical overview of MELAS syndrome, a rare mitochondrial disorder affecting the nervous system and muscles, typically beginning in childhood.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of MELAS (Mitochondrial Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis, and Stroke-like episodes) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that primarily manifests in childhood between ages 2-15. The document details the characteristic symptoms including seizures, recurrent headaches, gastrointestinal issues, and distinctive stroke-like episodes that can cause hemiparesis, altered consciousness, and sensory impairments. It explains the genetic basis of the condition, noting that MELAS is primarily caused by mitochondrial DNA mutations, with rare cases linked to nuclear gene POLG1 mutations. The document emphasizes that while MELAS affects both sexes equally and represents the most common mitochondrial myopathy caused by mtDNA mutations, it may be underdiagnosed in clinical practice.",
