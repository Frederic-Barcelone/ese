With treatment and low protein diet, the disorder becomes chronically intermittent, and a nearly normal life is possible. Isovaeric Acidemia is a genetic disorder inherited through autosomal recessive genes. Symptoms are the result of a deficiency of the enzyme isovaleric co-enzyme A (CoA) dehydrogenase, which is needed for the breakdown of the amino acid leucine. Human traits, including the classic genetic diseases, are the product of the interaction of two genes for that condition, one received from the father and one from the mother. In recessive disorders, the condition does not appear unless a person inherits the same defective gene for the same trait from each parent. If an i",
