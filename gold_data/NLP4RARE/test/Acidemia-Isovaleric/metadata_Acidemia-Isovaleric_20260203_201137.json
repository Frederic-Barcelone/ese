  "short_description": "Clinical overview of isovaleric acidemia, a rare hereditary metabolic disorder caused by isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency affecting leucine metabolism.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of isovaleric acidemia, a rare autosomal recessive metabolic disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The text describes the clinical presentation including acute and chronic intermittent forms, with symptoms such as vomiting, feeding difficulties, and listlessness. It explains the genetic inheritance pattern, emphasizing the autosomal recessive nature with 25% transmission risk when both parents are carriers. The document details the biochemical basis involving impaired leucine metabolism and discusses treatment approaches including low protein diet management that can enable patients to live nearly normal lives.",
