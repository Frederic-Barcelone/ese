  "short_description": "Clinical overview of isovaleric acidemia, a rare hereditary metabolic disorder caused by isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase deficiency affecting leucine metabolism.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of isovaleric acidemia, a rare autosomal recessive hereditary metabolic disorder characterized by deficiency of the enzyme isovaleryl CoA dehydrogenase. The document details the clinical presentation including both acute and chronic intermittent forms, with symptoms such as vomiting, feeding refusal, and listlessness in the acute phase. It explains the genetic inheritance pattern, noting that the disorder results from mutations affecting leucine amino acid breakdown and requires inheritance of defective genes from both parents. The document also covers treatment approaches including low protein diet management, prognosis for near-normal life with proper treatment, and epidemiological information indicating equal prevalence in males and females with typical onset during infancy.",
