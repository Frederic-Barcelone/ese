  "short_description": "Clinical overview of congenital disorders of glycosylation, discussing their epidemiology, diagnostic challenges, and prevalence patterns.",
  "long_description": "This document provides information about congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG), a group of genetic conditions that affect both males and females equally. The text discusses the challenges in determining accurate prevalence data due to underrecognition and misdiagnosis of these conditions. It highlights that PMM2-CDG is the most common subtype, with over 700 reported cases, and notes that these disorders typically manifest during infancy. The document emphasizes the need for increased awareness and recognition of CDG subtypes to improve diagnostic accuracy and understanding of their true frequency in the general population.",
