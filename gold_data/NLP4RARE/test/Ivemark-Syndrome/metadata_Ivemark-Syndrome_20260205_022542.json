  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Ivemark syndrome, a rare multi-system disorder that primarily affects infants and children. The condition is characterized by three main features: absence or underdevelopment of the spleen (asplenia or hypoplasia), congenital heart malformations, and abnormal arrangement of internal organs in the chest and abdomen. The document details the variable symptom presentation, including cyanosis, heart murmurs, and congestive heart failure, which often lead to life-threatening complications in infancy. It notes the male predominance of the condition and discusses the epidemiological context within the broader category of laterality disorders, which affect approximately 1 in 15,000 people in the general population.",
