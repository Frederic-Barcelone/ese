  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Degos disease, a rare occlusive arteriopathy affecting small and medium arteries with characteristic skin lesions and potential systemic complications.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Degos disease, an extremely rare vascular disorder characterized by occlusive arteriopathy affecting small and medium-sized arteries. The document details the clinical presentation, including characteristic skin lesions that may persist from weeks to years, and distinguishes between benign cutaneous and systemic forms of the disease. It covers the systemic manifestations, particularly gastrointestinal involvement with small intestine lesions, and associated symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, and weight loss. The document emphasizes the serious complications of systemic Degos disease, including life-threatening bowel perforations and peritonitis. It also addresses the diagnostic challenges, noting that the diagnosis relies primarily on clinical evaluation, patient history, characteristic findings, and histopathological examination of skin tissue, as standard laboratory tests are typically normal.",
