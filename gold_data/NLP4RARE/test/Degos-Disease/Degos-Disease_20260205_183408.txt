Degos disease is an extremely rare disorder in which small and medium sized arteries become blocked (occlusive arteriopathy), restricting the flow of blood to affected areas. Degos disease usually causes characteristic skin lesions that may last for a period of time ranging from weeks to years. In some individuals, Degos disease will be limited to the skin (benign cutaneous Degos disease); other individuals will also develop symptoms affecting other organ systems (systemic Degos disease). Systemic Degos disease is most frequently characterized by lesions in the small intestine, but other organs are also affected. Major symptoms may include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and/or weight loss. The systemic form of Degos disease can cause life-threatening complications such as perforated bowels leading to inflammation of the abdominal cavity (peritonitis). The exact cause of Degos disease is unknown. A diagnosis of Degos disease is made based upon a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, identification of characteristic findings (e.g., skin lesions), and microscopic examination of affected skin tissue that reveal distinctive changes to that tissue. Because most tests are normal, no specific laboratory test can be used to aid in the diagnosis of Degos disease.
