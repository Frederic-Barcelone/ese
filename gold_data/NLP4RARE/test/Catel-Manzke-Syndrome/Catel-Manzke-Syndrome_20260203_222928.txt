The incidence and prevalence of Catel-Manzke syndrome is unknown. More than 33 individuals with the disorder have been reported in the medical literature. Since some individuals may go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, determining the true frequency of Catel-Manzke syndrome in the general population is difficult. More males have been described with the disorder than females, but this may be a coincidence since so few individuals have been reported in the medical literature.
