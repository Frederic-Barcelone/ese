  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Catel-Manzke syndrome incidence, prevalence, and demographic characteristics based on reported cases in medical literature.",
  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Catel-Manzke syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. It discusses the challenges in determining accurate incidence and prevalence rates due to the limited number of reported cases (more than 33 individuals) and potential underdiagnosis. The document notes demographic patterns, including a higher reported frequency in males compared to females, while acknowledging this may be coincidental given the small sample size. The content highlights the difficulties in establishing true population frequency for rare genetic conditions and emphasizes the need for better diagnostic recognition and reporting.",
