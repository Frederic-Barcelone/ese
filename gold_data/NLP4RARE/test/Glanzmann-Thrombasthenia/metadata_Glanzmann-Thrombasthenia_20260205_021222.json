  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Glanzmann thrombasthenia (GT), a rare inherited bleeding disorder that typically manifests at birth or in early infancy. The text details the characteristic symptoms including easy bruising, profuse bleeding after surgical procedures, nosebleeds, gum bleeding, gastrointestinal bleeding, and purpura. It specifically addresses gender-specific manifestations such as heavy menstrual bleeding and childbirth complications in women. The document also covers the epidemiological aspects of the condition, noting its equal prevalence between males and females, the estimated 500 reported cases worldwide, and its higher frequency in populations with increased consanguinity, particularly in regions of the Middle East, India, and France.",
