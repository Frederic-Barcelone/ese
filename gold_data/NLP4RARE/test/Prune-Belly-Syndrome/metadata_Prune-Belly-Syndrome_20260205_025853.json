  "title": "Prune-Belly Syndrome (Eagle-Barrett Syndrome): Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Considerations",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Prune-Belly syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by absent abdominal muscles, cryptorchidism, and urinary tract malformations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Prune-Belly syndrome, also known as Eagle-Barrett syndrome, a rare congenital disorder that primarily affects males. The document details the characteristic triad of symptoms including partial or complete absence of abdominal muscles, bilateral cryptorchidism (undescended testes), and various urinary tract malformations such as ureteral dilation, hydroureter, hydronephrosis, and vesicoureteral reflux. It discusses potential complications including pulmonary hypoplasia and chronic renal failure, while acknowledging that the exact etiology remains unknown. The document emphasizes the importance of thorough diagnostic evaluation using imaging modalities such as ultrasound, X-ray, and intravenous pyelogram to assess the extent of genitourinary involvement and guide clinical management.",
