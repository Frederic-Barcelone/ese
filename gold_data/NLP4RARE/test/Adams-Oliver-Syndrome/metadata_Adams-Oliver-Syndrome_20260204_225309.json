  "short_description": "Clinical documentation of Adams-Oliver syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by congenital scalp defects and limb abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), an extremely rare inherited disorder affecting fewer than 125 documented cases worldwide. The document details the characteristic features of AOS, including congenital scalp defects with hairless scarred areas and dilated blood vessels, potential skull bone defects, and various limb malformations ranging from shortened digits to absent hands or lower legs. It covers the genetic inheritance patterns (primarily autosomal dominant, with some autosomal recessive cases), equal gender distribution, diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation and advanced imaging techniques, and the possibility of prenatal detection through fetal ultrasonography. The document serves as a clinical reference for healthcare professionals managing patients with this rare congenital disorder.",
