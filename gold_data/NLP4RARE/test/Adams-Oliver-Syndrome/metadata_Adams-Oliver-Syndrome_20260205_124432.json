  "short_description": "Clinical documentation describing Adams-Oliver syndrome, a rare inherited disorder characterized by congenital scalp defects and limb abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Adams-Oliver syndrome (AOS), an extremely rare inherited disorder affecting approximately 125 documented cases. The document details the characteristic features including congenital scalp defects with hairless scarred areas, potential skull bone abnormalities, and various limb malformations ranging from shortened digits to absent hands or lower legs. It covers the variable severity of presentations, inheritance patterns (primarily autosomal dominant with some autosomal recessive cases), equal gender distribution, and diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history, and advanced imaging techniques. The document also discusses prenatal detection possibilities through fetal ultrasonography.",
