  "short_description": "Clinical document describing acquired neuromyotonia, an autoimmune disorder characterized by continuous muscle contractions and affecting neuromuscular junctions.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of acquired neuromyotonia, an autoimmune disease where the immune system attacks the body's own tissues. The document details the pathophysiology involving antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels (VGKCs) that disrupt neuromuscular junction function in approximately 40% of cases. It covers the epidemiological aspects, noting the condition affects both sexes with a slight male predominance and typically manifests between ages 15-60, though childhood cases are reported. The document outlines key diagnostic criteria including continuous muscle contractions (myokymia), particularly in facial and hand muscles, rhythmic fasciculations, and muscle cramps, with electromyography serving as the confirmatory diagnostic tool.",
