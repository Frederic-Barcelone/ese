  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of X-linked lymphoproliferative (XLP) syndrome, an extremely rare primary immunodeficiency disorder that affects approximately 1-2 per million males. The condition is characterized by a defective immune system that responds abnormally to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection, which typically causes only mild infectious mononucleosis in healthy individuals. In XLP patients, EBV exposure can lead to severe complications including fulminant hepatitis, hypogammaglobulinemia with increased infection susceptibility, B-cell lymphomas, and other serious abnormalities. The document details the variable clinical presentation, typical age of onset (6 months to 10 years), and epidemiological data showing over 400 documented cases across more than 80 families worldwide.",
