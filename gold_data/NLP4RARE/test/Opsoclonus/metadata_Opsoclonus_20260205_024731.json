  "title": "Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (OMS): Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Approach",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder characterized by dancing eyes, muscle spasms, and ataxia, often associated with neuroblastoma in children.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Opsoclonus-Myoclonus Syndrome (OMS), a rare neurological disorder affecting approximately 1 per million individuals worldwide. The document details the characteristic symptoms including opsoclonus (rapid, multidirectional eye movements), myoclonus (shock-like muscle spasms), ataxia (unsteady gait), and behavioral disturbances. It explains the age-related etiology patterns, with paraneoplastic causes (particularly neuroblastoma) being most common in young children, while viral infections are more frequent in older children and teens. The document outlines diagnostic approaches including imaging studies, cerebrospinal fluid analysis, and biomarkers, emphasizing that diagnosis remains primarily clinical as no specific diagnostic test exists.",
