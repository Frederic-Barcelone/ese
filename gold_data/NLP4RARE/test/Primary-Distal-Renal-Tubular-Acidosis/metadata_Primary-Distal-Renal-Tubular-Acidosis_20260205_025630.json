  "short_description": "Clinical overview of primary distal renal tubular acidosis, discussing its equal gender distribution and diagnostic challenges in determining prevalence.",
  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about primary distal renal tubular acidosis, a rare kidney disorder that affects the body's ability to acidify urine. The content emphasizes that the condition affects both males and females equally, with no gender predisposition. The document highlights significant challenges in determining the true prevalence of this disorder, noting that rare conditions like primary distal renal tubular acidosis are frequently misdiagnosed or remain undiagnosed, making accurate epidemiological assessment difficult. This underscores the importance of increased awareness and improved diagnostic approaches for rare renal disorders.",
