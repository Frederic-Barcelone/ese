  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Carpenter syndrome (ACPS type II), a rare genetic disorder belonging to the acrocephalopolysyndactyly group. The condition is characterized by premature closure of cranial sutures leading to pointed skull appearance, webbing or fusion of digits, and extra digits. The document discusses the equal gender distribution, prevalence data from over 70 recorded cases, and genetic findings including a founder effect in northern European populations where homozygous nonsense mutations have been identified in 10 analyzed patients, suggesting common ancestral origins of the disease-causing mutation.",
