  "short_description": "Clinical document discussing the unknown etiology, demographics, and diagnostic approach for Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MDD), a balance disorder following motion exposure.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of Mal de Débarquement Syndrome (MDD), a poorly understood balance disorder that occurs after exposure to motion stimuli such as ocean cruises, flights, or road trips. The document explains that while the exact cause remains unknown, MDD likely involves the body's balance system failing to properly process and adapt to multiple sensory inputs after the triggering stimulus has ended. It highlights that the condition predominantly affects adult females and may be more common in patients with migraine history. The document emphasizes that MDD diagnosis remains primarily clinical, relying heavily on patient history of persistent dizziness following motion exposure, as vestibular function tests typically show normal or nonspecific results.",
