The true cause behind MDD is still unknown. MDD likely results from the body’s balance system inadequately processing and adapting to multiple sensory inputs (visual, vestibular, proprioceptive and cognitive) from the environment once the stimulus (trigger) has ended. It is as yet undetermined as to the cause of the balance system’s inability to appropriately compensate and adapt. How or why this happens remains a mystery. The majority of people affected are adult females, although there have been reports of males having the diagnosis. Patients with migraine may have any increased susceptibility through unknown mechanisms. The diagnosis of MDD still remains mostly clinical. As such, the history is very important. Persistent “dizziness” after an ocean cruise, a sailing trip, a prolonged airplane flight or a cross-country road trip is highly suggestive of MDD. Vestibular function tests in patients with MDD have been normal or nonspecific in their abnormality. These tests are important in excluding other etiologies for the patient's symptoms.
