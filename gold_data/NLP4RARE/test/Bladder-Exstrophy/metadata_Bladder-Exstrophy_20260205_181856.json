  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the spectrum of congenital anomalies in the bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex, including developmental causes and prevalence data.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of the bladder exstrophy-epispadias-cloacal exstrophy complex, a spectrum of congenital anomalies affecting multiple organ systems including the urinary tract, genital tract, musculoskeletal system, and sometimes the intestinal tract. The document explains the normal developmental process involving the cloacal membrane and describes how developmental abnormalities occurring 4-5 weeks after conception lead to this complex. It includes epidemiological data showing birth prevalence rates ranging from 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 50,000 for classic bladder exstrophy, with males affected 2-3 times more frequently than females. The document also covers prenatal diagnostic features that may be detected through ultrasound examination, making it a valuable resource for healthcare professionals involved in prenatal care and pediatric urology.",
