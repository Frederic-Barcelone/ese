  "title": "Bloom Syndrome: A Rare Genetic Disorder with Increased Cancer Risk",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Bloom syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by short stature, photosensitivity, and markedly increased cancer susceptibility due to DNA repair defects.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Bloom syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that serves as a prototype for chromosome breakage syndromes. The condition is characterized by multiple clinical manifestations including short stature, increased skin sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, distinctive telangiectasia forming a butterfly pattern on the face, mild immunodeficiency, and most significantly, a dramatically elevated risk for various cancers including leukemia, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal tumors. The document explains the underlying pathophysiology, highlighting how genetic abnormalities in DNA repair mechanisms lead to increased chromosome breaks and rearrangements, which directly contribute to the heightened cancer risk that defines this syndrome.",
