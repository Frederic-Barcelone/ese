  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Bloom syndrome, a rare genetic disorder that serves as a prototype for chromosome breakage syndromes. The condition is characterized by multiple clinical manifestations including short stature, increased skin sensitivity to ultraviolet radiation, distinctive telangiectasia forming a butterfly pattern on the face, mild immunodeficiency, and most significantly, a dramatically elevated risk for various cancers including leukemia, lymphoma, and gastrointestinal tumors. The underlying pathophysiology involves defective DNA repair mechanisms that lead to increased chromosome breaks and rearrangements, directly contributing to the heightened cancer predisposition that defines this syndrome.",
