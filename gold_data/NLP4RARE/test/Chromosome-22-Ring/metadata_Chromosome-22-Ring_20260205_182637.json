  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Chromosome 22 Ring, a rare chromosomal disorder affecting the 22nd chromosome. The text details the highly variable presentation of this condition, which typically involves moderate to severe mental retardation as a primary feature. The document describes associated physical manifestations including hypotonia, motor coordination difficulties, gait abnormalities, and verbal delays. Craniofacial malformations are highlighted as common findings, encompassing microcephaly, epicanthal folds, enlarged ears, and other structural abnormalities. The document explains the etiology as spontaneous de novo chromosomal errors occurring during early embryonic development, notes a female predominance in reported cases, and indicates that over 50 cases have been documented in medical literature.",
