Horner syndrome is a relatively rare disorder characterized by a constricted pupil (miosis), drooping of the upper eyelid (ptosis), absence of sweating of the face (anhidrosis), and sinking of the eyeball into the bony cavity that protects the eye (enophthalmos). These are the four classic signs of the disorder. Horner syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and may occur at any age, among any ethnic grouping in any geographic location. The diagnosis of Horner syndrome and the localization of the lesions that cause the disorder can be determined by pharmacological tests combined with imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging and ultrasonography of the carotid artery.
