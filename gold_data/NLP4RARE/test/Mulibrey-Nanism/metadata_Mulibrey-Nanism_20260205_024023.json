  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Mulibrey nanism, an extremely rare genetic disorder affecting muscle, liver, brain, and eye development with characteristic growth delays and constrictive pericarditis.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Mulibrey nanism, an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects approximately 110 patients worldwide. The condition is characterized by profound growth delays, low birth weight, short stature, and distinctive abnormalities across multiple organ systems including muscles (hypotonia), liver (hepatomegaly), brain, and eyes (yellow discoloration). A notable feature is constrictive pericarditis caused by overgrowth of the fibrous pericardial sac. The disorder affects males and females equally, with most reported cases originating from Finland, though cases have been documented across multiple continents including North and South America, Europe, and Africa.",
