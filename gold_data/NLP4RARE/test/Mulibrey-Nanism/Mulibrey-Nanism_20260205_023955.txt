Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder characterized by profound growth delays and distinctive abnormalities of the muscles, liver, brain, and eyes. The acronym MULIBREY stands for (MU)scle, (Ll)ver, (BR)ain, and (EY)e. Nanism is another word for dwarfism. A characteristic feature not included in the original acronym is the overgrowth of the fibrous sac that surrounds the heart restricting normal filling of the heart (constrictive pericarditis). Characteristic symptoms may include low birth weight, short stature, and severe progressive growth delays. Muscles are usually underdeveloped and lack normal tone (hypotonia). Some infants with this disorder may have an abnormally large liver (hepatomegaly). Infants typically have yellow discoloration in their eyes. Mulibrey nanism is an extremely rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers. Approximately 110 patients have been reported worldwide with this condition. Most of the reported cases are from Finland but this condition has also occurred in North America, South America, Central America, Spain, France and Egypt.
