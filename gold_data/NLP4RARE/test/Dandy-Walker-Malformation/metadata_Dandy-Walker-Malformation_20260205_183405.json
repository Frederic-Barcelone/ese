  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Dandy-Walker malformation, a brain malformation affecting cerebellar development during embryonic growth, including its genetic causes and diagnostic approaches.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM), a congenital brain malformation that occurs during embryonic development of the cerebellum and 4th ventricle. The document details the anatomical characteristics of DWM, including underdevelopment of the cerebellar vermis, cystic enlargement of the 4th ventricle, and posterior fossa enlargement. It covers associated conditions such as hydrocephalus, genetic factors including chromosome abnormalities and inheritance patterns, epidemiological data showing a frequency of 1 per 25,000-35,000 live births with female predominance, and diagnostic methods including ultrasound, CT, MRI, and prenatal screening techniques.",
