  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe childhood epilepsy characterized by multiple seizure types and developmental challenges.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS), a severe form of epilepsy that manifests in infancy or early childhood. The document details the characteristic seizure types including atonic, tonic, and atypical absence seizures, along with associated complications such as cognitive dysfunction, developmental delays, and behavioral problems. It addresses the varied etiology of the condition, noting that while multiple underlying causes exist, some cases remain idiopathic. The document emphasizes the treatment challenges posed by the syndrome's resistance to conventional antiseizure medications and mentions ongoing research efforts. Epidemiological data is provided, including prevalence rates, gender distribution, and typical age of onset between 2-7 years with peak incidence at 3-5 years.",
