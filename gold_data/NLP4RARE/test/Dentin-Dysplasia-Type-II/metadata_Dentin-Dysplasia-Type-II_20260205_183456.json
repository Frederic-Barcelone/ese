  "long_description": "This clinical reference document outlines the diagnostic methodology for dentin dysplasia type II, also known as coronal dentin dysplasia. The document details the comprehensive diagnostic approach which includes identification of characteristic clinical symptoms, obtaining a detailed patient medical history, and conducting thorough clinical evaluations. It specifically describes the radiographic features that aid in diagnosis, including abnormal coronal pulp formation, obliteration of pulp chambers, presence of pulp stones, and the distinctive thistle-shaped deformity of the pulp chamber that is pathognomonic for this condition.",
