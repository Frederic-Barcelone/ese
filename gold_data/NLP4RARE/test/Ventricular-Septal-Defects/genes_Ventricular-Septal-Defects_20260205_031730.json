      "context": "known. These defects probably occur as the result of errors in the development of an embryo. During the early part of fetal development there is no wall (septum) to separate the left and right ventricles. As the fetus grows, so does a muscular wall that splits the lower chamber into two ventricles. If the muscle does not form a solid wall, a hole remains and is what is called the ventricular septal defect. The why and how of these developmental errors is not fully understood. However, research suggests that they may occur as the result of the complex interaction of many factors, both genetic and",
