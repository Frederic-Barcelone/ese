  "short_description": "Medical document explaining ventricular septal defects (VSDs), congenital heart defects characterized by holes in the wall separating the heart's lower chambers.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of ventricular septal defects (VSDs), which are congenital heart defects present at birth. The document explains normal heart anatomy, including the four-chamber structure with atria and ventricles separated by septa, and describes how VSDs occur when the ventricular septum fails to form completely during fetal development. It discusses the embryological development process where the lower heart chamber initially lacks a separating wall, which normally develops into a muscular septum as the fetus grows. The document addresses the unknown exact causes of VSDs while noting that research suggests these developmental errors likely result from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors (multifactorial inheritance).",
