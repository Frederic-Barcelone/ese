  "short_description": "Clinical documentation of heterozygous OSMED, a rare genetic disorder causing skeletal malformations, short stature, and developmental delays that typically normalize by early childhood.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of heterozygous oto-spondyl-megaepiphyseal dysplasia (OSMED), a rare genetic condition caused by mutations in the COL11A2 gene. The document details the characteristic clinical presentation including rhizomelic dwarfism with shortening of upper limbs and thighs, distinctive facial features, and initial psychomotor developmental delays. It emphasizes the positive prognosis, noting that bone growth gradually improves leading to normal physical development by early childhood, with mental and motor development also normalizing during this period. The document covers diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, and specialized imaging studies, particularly X-rays that reveal characteristic skeletal malformations. Additional complications such as potential hearing loss are also addressed.",
