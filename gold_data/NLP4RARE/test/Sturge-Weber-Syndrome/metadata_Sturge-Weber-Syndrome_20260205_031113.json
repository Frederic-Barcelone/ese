  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on Sturge-Weber Syndrome, a rare neurological disorder. It presents statistical information about the condition's incidence rate (1 in 20,000-50,000 live births), equal gender distribution, and the relationship between port-wine birthmarks and neurological complications. The document specifically addresses risk stratification based on birthmark location, noting that facial port-wine birthmarks carry a 6% risk of developing SWS neurological abnormalities, which increases to 26% when located on the forehead, temple, or upper facial regions. It also confirms that SWS affects all racial and ethnic groups equally.",
