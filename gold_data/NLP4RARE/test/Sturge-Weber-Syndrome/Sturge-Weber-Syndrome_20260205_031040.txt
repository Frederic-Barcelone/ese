SWS affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence and prevalence is unknown. One estimate places the incidence at 1 in 20,000-50,000 live births. Approximately 3 in 1,000 babies are born with a port-wine birthmark, but only approximately 6% of individuals with a port-wine birthmark on the face develop the neurological abnormalities associated with SWS. The risk increases to 26% when the port-wine birthmark is on the forehead, temple region or upper part of the face. SWS can affect individuals of any race or ethnicity.
