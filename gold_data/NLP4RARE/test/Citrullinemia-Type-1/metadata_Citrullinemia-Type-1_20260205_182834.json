  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of citrullinemia type 1 (CTLN1), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that affects approximately 1 in 57,000 births. The document describes the various clinical forms of CTLN1, including the neonatal acute (classic) form, a milder late-onset form, a pregnancy-associated form that begins during or after pregnancy, and an asymptomatic form. This information serves as a reference for understanding the clinical spectrum and epidemiology of this rare metabolic disorder.",
