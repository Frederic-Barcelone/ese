  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides an overview of citrullinemia type I (CTLN1), a rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that manifests in several distinct forms. The document outlines the various clinical presentations including the neonatal acute (classic) form, a milder late-onset variant, a pregnancy-associated form that can begin during or after pregnancy, and an asymptomatic form. The document establishes the epidemiological context by noting the disorder's occurrence rate of approximately 1 in 57,000 births, making it a significant rare disease for clinical consideration and genetic counseling purposes.",
