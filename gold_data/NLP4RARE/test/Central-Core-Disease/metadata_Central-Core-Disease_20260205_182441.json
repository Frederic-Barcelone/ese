  "short_description": "Clinical document describing central core disease (CCD), a rare congenital myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, and potential complications including malignant hyperthermia.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of central core disease (CCD), a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder classified as a congenital myopathy. The document details the clinical presentation including diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), proximal muscle weakness affecting shoulders, pelvis, and upper extremities, and associated skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis. It covers developmental delays in motor milestones, the risk of malignant hyperthermia during anesthesia, and discusses the variable severity of the condition. The document also addresses the genetic inheritance patterns, distinguishing between autosomal dominant cases with generally favorable prognosis and autosomal recessive cases associated with more severe complications.",
