  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of central core disease (CCD), a rare genetic neuromuscular disorder classified as a congenital myopathy. The document details the clinical presentation including diminished muscle tone (hypotonia), muscle weakness primarily affecting proximal muscles, skeletal abnormalities such as scoliosis, and developmental delays in motor milestones. It also addresses the potential for malignant hyperthermia reactions to anesthetic drugs and discusses the inheritance patterns, noting that autosomal dominant cases typically have better prognoses while autosomal recessive cases may present with more severe complications.",
