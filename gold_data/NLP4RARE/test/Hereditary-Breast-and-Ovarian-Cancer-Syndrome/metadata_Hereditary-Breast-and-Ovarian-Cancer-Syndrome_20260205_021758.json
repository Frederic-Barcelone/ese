  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome, detailing its prevalence across various ethnic and racial populations. The document explains that HBOC syndrome is the most common cause of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, affecting both men and women universally. It presents prevalence estimates ranging from 1 in 200 to 1 in 800 people in the general population, with notably higher rates in Ashkenazi Jewish populations (1 in 40 people) due to founder effects. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding the genetic epidemiology and population-specific risks associated with HBOC syndrome.",
