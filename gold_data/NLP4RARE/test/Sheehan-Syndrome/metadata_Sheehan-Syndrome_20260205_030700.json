  "title": "Sheehan Syndrome: Postpartum Hypopituitarism Following Excessive Blood Loss",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Sheehan syndrome, a form of maternal hypopituitarism caused by pituitary gland damage due to excessive bleeding during or after childbirth.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical explanation of Sheehan syndrome, a serious postpartum complication characterized by hypopituitarism resulting from pituitary gland damage. The condition occurs when excessive blood loss during or after delivery leads to reduced blood flow to the pituitary gland, causing cellular damage or necrosis. The document details the pathophysiology, explaining how the enlarged pituitary gland during pregnancy becomes particularly vulnerable to circulatory shock. It distinguishes between acute and chronic forms of the syndrome based on the extent of cellular damage, with acute cases presenting symptoms immediately after delivery and chronic cases potentially remaining asymptomatic for months or years. The text also covers diagnostic approaches and the critical importance of early treatment in cases of severe postpartum hemorrhage.",
