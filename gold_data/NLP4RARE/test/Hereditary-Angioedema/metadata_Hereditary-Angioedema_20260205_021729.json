  "short_description": "Clinical document describing hereditary angioedema, a rare disorder affecting 1 in 50,000-150,000 individuals worldwide, with diagnostic criteria and testing recommendations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of hereditary angioedema, a rare genetic disorder that affects males and females equally with symptoms typically manifesting in early childhood. The document outlines the epidemiology, showing the condition affects an estimated 1 in 50,000 to 150,000 individuals globally. It details the diagnostic approach, which involves comprehensive clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and specific blood tests to detect decreased complement protein levels. The document emphasizes that genetic testing is indicated in cases of high clinical suspicion with recurrent episodic angioedema of uncertain origin.",
