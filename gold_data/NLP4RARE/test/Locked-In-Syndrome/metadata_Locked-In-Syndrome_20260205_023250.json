  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of locked-in syndrome, a rare neurological condition that presents significant diagnostic and epidemiological challenges. The document explains that the disorder affects males and females equally and can occur across all age groups, though it is most commonly observed in adults who have higher risk factors for brain stroke and bleeding. The text highlights the difficulty in determining accurate prevalence rates due to frequent misdiagnosis and underrecognition of cases in the general population, emphasizing the need for better awareness and diagnostic protocols for this complex neurological condition.",
