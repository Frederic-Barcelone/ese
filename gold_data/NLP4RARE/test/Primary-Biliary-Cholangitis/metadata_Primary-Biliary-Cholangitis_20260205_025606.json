  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a detailed explanation of primary biliary cholangitis (PBC), a chronic autoimmune liver condition that predominantly affects women during middle age. The document covers the pathophysiology of PBC, including inflammation and scarring of small bile ducts, disease progression through four stages from early disease to cirrhosis, and potential complications such as jaundice and liver failure. It discusses the multifactorial etiology involving autoimmune, genetic, and environmental factors, demographic patterns showing higher prevalence in women aged 45-65, and epidemiological data indicating PBC affects approximately 1 in 1000 women over age 40, making it one of the most common autoimmune diseases.",
