  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on Castleman disease, a rare lymphoproliferative disorder. It details the demographic distribution across different subtypes: unicentric Castleman disease (UCD) and idiopathic multicentric Castleman disease (iMCD) affect males and females equally with no known risk factors, while HHV-8-associated multicentric Castleman disease shows male predominance. The document highlights that HIV-positive individuals have increased risk for HHV-8-associated MCD and provides prevalence estimates, indicating approximately 5,000 new diagnoses annually and 30,000 total affected individuals in the United States across all forms of the disease.",
