  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides comprehensive epidemiological information about Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), a neurodegenerative disorder. The document details key demographic patterns showing equal gender distribution, peak onset between ages 55-60, and incidence rates of 0.6 cases per 100,000 people annually in the United States. It includes prevalence data from international studies, estimates of current case numbers in the USA, and comparative statistics with Parkinson's disease, highlighting that MSA has a shorter survival rate despite lower overall prevalence. The document serves as a reference for understanding the population impact and clinical burden of this rare neurological condition.",
