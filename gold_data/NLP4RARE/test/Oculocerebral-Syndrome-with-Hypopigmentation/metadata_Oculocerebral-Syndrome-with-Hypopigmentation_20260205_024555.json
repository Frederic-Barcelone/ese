  "long_description": "This document describes Oculocerebral Syndrome with Hypopigmentation, an extremely rare autosomal recessive genetic disorder that presents with distinctive physical and neurological features. The condition is characterized by hypopigmentation manifesting as unusually light skin color and silvery-gray hair at birth. Central nervous system abnormalities include ocular defects such as microphthalmia, corneal opacities, and nystagmus. During infancy, patients may develop additional complications including spastic paraplegia due to involuntary muscle contractions, developmental delays, and intellectual disability. The document provides a comprehensive overview of the clinical presentation and inheritance pattern of this rare genetic condition.",
