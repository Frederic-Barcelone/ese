  "short_description": "Clinical overview of trisomy 5p, a rare chromosomal disorder involving duplication of chromosome 5's short arm, affecting over 40 documented cases since 1964.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of trisomy 5p, a rare chromosomal disorder characterized by the presence of three copies of all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 5 instead of the normal two copies. The condition, first described by Lejeune in 1964, presents with variable phenotypes depending on the specific chromosomal rearrangements involved, the size of the duplication, and potential loss of genetic material from other chromosomes. The disorder shows a slight female predominance and affects all ethnic groups, with more than 40 cases documented in medical literature. The document emphasizes that while clinical features may appear consistent, definitive diagnosis cannot be made based solely on clinical presentation, as many symptoms overlap with other genetic conditions and chromosomal abnormalities.",
