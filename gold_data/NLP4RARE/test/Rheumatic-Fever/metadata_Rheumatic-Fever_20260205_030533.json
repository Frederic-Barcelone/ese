  "short_description": "Clinical document describing rheumatic fever as an inflammatory disease following streptococcal infections, primarily affecting children aged 6-16.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of rheumatic fever, an inflammatory disease that is rare in the United States but more prevalent in other regions globally. The document explains that rheumatic fever primarily affects children between 6 and 16 years of age and develops as a complication following untreated Group A streptococcal infections such as strep throat or scarlet fever. It notes that approximately 5% of individuals with untreated strep infections will develop rheumatic fever, though the exact pathophysiological mechanism remains unclear. The document emphasizes important distinctions regarding contagiousness and recurrence patterns, noting that while strep throat is highly contagious, rheumatic fever itself is not transmissible, and individuals with a history of rheumatic fever are prone to flare-ups with subsequent streptococcal infections.",
