  "title": "Arachnoiditis: Differential Diagnosis and Clinical Considerations",
  "short_description": "Clinical document discussing conditions with similar presentations to arachnoiditis and diagnostic challenges in identifying this spinal condition.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document examines the differential diagnosis of arachnoiditis, a spinal condition affecting the arachnoid membrane. It outlines various conditions that present with similar signs and symptoms, including failed back surgery syndrome, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, chronic pain syndrome, cauda equina syndrome, syringomyelia, and spinal cord tumors. The document highlights the diagnostic complexity that arises when these conditions occur as complications of arachnoiditis and addresses the unfortunate tendency for some patients' symptoms to be dismissed as psychosomatic, emphasizing the importance of proper clinical evaluation and recognition of this legitimate medical condition.",
