There are numerous conditions characterized by signs and symptoms that are similar to those found in arachnoiditis, however, only a few will be listed. They include the failed back surgery syndrome, multiple sclerosis, fibromyalgia, reflex sympathetic dystrophy, chronic pain syndrome, cauda equina syndrome, syringomyelia, and some spinal cord tumors. In many cases, certain conditions can arise as complications of arachnoiditis, further rendering the diagnosis, more complex. Occasionally, the symptoms manifested by some individuals with arachnoiditis may be dismissed as psychosomatic and these patients may be branded as “pain is in your head” cases.
