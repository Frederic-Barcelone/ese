  "long_description": "This document provides a concise clinical overview of Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome, explaining that it shares similarities with Li-Fraumeni syndrome but does not fulfill the classic diagnostic criteria. The document appears to be part of a larger clinical reference or testing guide, as it references additional clinical testing information. Li-Fraumeni-like syndrome represents a variant or atypical presentation of the hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome, requiring different diagnostic considerations and clinical management approaches.",
