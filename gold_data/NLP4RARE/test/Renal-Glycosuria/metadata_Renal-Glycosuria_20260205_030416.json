  "short_description": "Clinical document describing renal glycosuria, a rare inherited condition characterized by glucose excretion in urine despite normal blood glucose levels.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of renal glycosuria (renal glucosuria), a rare autosomal recessive condition affecting kidney function. The document explains the pathophysiology involving improper functioning of renal tubules within nephrons, leading to abnormal glucose elimination in urine despite normal or low blood glucose levels. It covers the typically asymptomatic nature of the condition, potential complications during pregnancy or starvation, equal gender distribution, familial inheritance patterns, and diagnostic approaches using laboratory testing with overnight fasting protocols. The document serves as an educational resource for healthcare professionals managing patients with this uncommon renal disorder.",
