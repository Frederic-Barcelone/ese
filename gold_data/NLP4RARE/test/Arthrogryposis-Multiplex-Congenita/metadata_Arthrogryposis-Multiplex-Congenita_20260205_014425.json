  "short_description": "Clinical document describing arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a congenital condition characterized by multiple joint contractures affecting different body areas.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of arthrogryposis multiplex congenita (AMC), a congenital condition affecting approximately 1 in 3,000 individuals. The document explains the distinction between isolated congenital contractures and AMC, which involves multiple body areas. It covers the epidemiology, showing equal distribution between males and females across different ethnic groups, and details the diagnostic process including clinical evaluation, nerve conduction studies, electromyography, muscle biopsy, and advanced genomic testing. The document emphasizes the complexity of diagnosis due to multiple potential genetic mutations and the need for comprehensive testing including whole genome sequencing for accurate diagnosis.",
