  "short_description": "Clinical overview of GSD-IX inheritance patterns, prevalence rates, and demographic distribution across different subtypes.",
  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Glycogen Storage Disease Type IX (GSD-IX), detailing the inheritance patterns of both autosomal recessive and X-linked forms. It explains how the autosomal recessive variants affect males and females equally, while X-linked forms primarily impact males, though females can experience symptoms including hepatomegaly. The document reports that GSD-IX types A, B, and C affect approximately 1 in 100,000 individuals and represent about 25% of all glycogen storage disorders, making it one of the most common forms. It also notes diagnostic challenges that may lead to underestimation of true prevalence and mentions the extremely rare GSD-IXd subtype.",
