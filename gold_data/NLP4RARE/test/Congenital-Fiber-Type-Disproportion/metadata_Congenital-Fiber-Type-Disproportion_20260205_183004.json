  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of congenital fiber type disproportion (CFTD), a rare genetic muscle disease belonging to the congenital myopathies group. The document details the characteristic symptoms including loss of muscle tone (hypotonia), generalized muscle weakness, motor development delays, and associated complications such as scoliosis, hip dislocations, and joint contractures. It covers the epidemiology, noting equal prevalence between males and females, the historical context of the condition's identification in medical literature during the 1960s-70s, and the formal terminology established in 1973. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this uncommon congenital myopathy that affects muscle fiber composition and function from birth.",
