  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the epidemiology, risk factors, and diagnostic methods for paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH), a rare autoimmune hemolytic anemia.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides comprehensive information about paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCH), a rare form of autoimmune hemolytic anemia affecting 1-3 people per 100,000 in the general population. The document covers the epidemiology of both syphilitic and non-syphilitic forms of chronic PCH, noting their extremely rare occurrence with unknown prevalence rates. It discusses risk factors, highlighting that while anyone can acquire PCH, it is more common in children and individuals with viral infections, with no known genetic, sex, or racial predispositions. The document emphasizes diagnostic considerations, particularly the importance of suspecting PCH in acutely ill children presenting with hemoglobinuria. It details the diagnostic process, including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, and specialized laboratory tests such as the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test and the definitive Donath-Landsteiner test, which uses a bi-phasic temperature protocol to confirm PCH diagnosis by distinguishing it from other forms of hemolytic anemia.",
