The document presents key statistical information including the estimated birth incidence rate of approximately 1 in 65,000 births, equal gender distribution, and historical context dating back to the original descriptions in 1894 and 1906. It also highlights demographic patterns, noting that over 300 cases have been documented in medical literature and that Asian populations show the highest reported incidence rates. This information serves as foundational epidemiological reference material for healthcare professionals and researchers studying this rare craniofacial syndrome.",
