Swyer syndrome affects girls who have an XY chromosomal makeup, no ovaries, but functional female organs including the uterus, fallopian tubes and vagina. The exact incidence is unknown. One estimate placed the incidence at 1 in 80,000 births. Another estimate placed the incidence of Swyer syndrome (complete gonadal dysgenesis) and partial gonadal dysgenesis combined at 1 in 20,000 births. Genital anomalies in general occur in approximately 1 in 4,500 births.
