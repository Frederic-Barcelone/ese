  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Swyer syndrome, a rare condition affecting individuals with XY chromosomes who develop functional female reproductive organs but lack ovaries.",
  "long_description": "This document provides clinical information about Swyer syndrome, a rare form of complete gonadal dysgenesis that affects individuals with XY chromosomal makeup. The condition is characterized by the absence of ovaries while maintaining functional female reproductive organs including the uterus, fallopian tubes, and vagina. The document discusses the epidemiology of the condition, noting varying incidence estimates ranging from 1 in 80,000 births for Swyer syndrome alone to 1 in 20,000 births when combined with partial gonadal dysgenesis. This information is valuable for healthcare providers and researchers working with disorders of sex development and reproductive endocrinology.",
