  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma (AITL), describing it as a rare form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that specifically affects T-lymphocytes. The content explains the classification of lymphomas, distinguishing between B-cell and T-cell types, and provides foundational information about the lymphatic system's role in immune function. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this specific type of cancer that affects white blood cells and the body's lymphatic network, including the system of lymph vessels that transport lymph fluid throughout the body.",
