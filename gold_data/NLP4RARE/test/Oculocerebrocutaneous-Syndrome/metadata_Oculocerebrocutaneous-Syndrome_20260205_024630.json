  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Oculocerebrocutaneous syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by eye, brain, and skin malformations affecting approximately 40 reported patients since 1981.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Oculocerebrocutaneous (OCC) syndrome (OMIM 164180), a rare genetic disorder present from birth that primarily affects three major organ systems. The syndrome is characterized by ocular abnormalities including orbital cysts and microphthalmos, cerebral malformations such as ventricular enlargement and corpus callosum agenesis, and cutaneous features including focal dermal hypoplasia and skin tags. Patients typically present with intellectual disability and seizures. The disorder occurs sporadically with no family history, shows a male predominance, and has been documented in approximately 40 cases since its original description by Delleman and Oorthuys in 1981.",
