PNENSs seem to affect women slightly more often than men. Individuals of any ethnic or racial group may develop a pNEN. Affected individuals usually develop sporadic pNENs between the ages of 30-60. When pNENs occur as part of a genetic syndrome, they tend to occur during childhood or young adulthood. PNENs affect approximately ~1 in 100,000 individuals in the general population per year. They account for approximately 2-4 percent of all pancreatic neoplasms. A diagnosis of a pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms (if present), a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including advanced imaging techniques (octrotide-scintigraphy, CT, MRI, PET-CT, PET-MRI), blood tests (Chromogranin A, NETest), biochemical tests, and also biopsies.
