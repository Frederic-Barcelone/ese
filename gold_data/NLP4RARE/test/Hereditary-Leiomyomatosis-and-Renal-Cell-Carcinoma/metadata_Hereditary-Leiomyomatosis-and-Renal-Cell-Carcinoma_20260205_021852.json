  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides information about Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Carcinoma (HLRCC), a genetic disorder that affects males and females equally. The document discusses the clinical presentation and recognition patterns of the condition, noting that HLRCC may be more easily identified in females due to the development of uterine fibroids and their associated symptoms. The text acknowledges that the exact incidence and prevalence of HLRCC in the general population remains unknown, highlighting gaps in current epidemiological understanding of this hereditary condition.",
