  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the rare congenital skin disorder CMTC, its unknown etiology, and diagnostic considerations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of Cutis Marmorata Telangiectatica Congenita (CMTC), a rare congenital skin disorder characterized by abnormal skin capillary patterns. The document discusses the unknown etiology of CMTC, noting that most cases occur spontaneously and may result from genetic mosaicism, with one theory suggesting abnormal pericyte recruitment causing inappropriate capillary contraction. It addresses the epidemiology, noting equal gender distribution, congenital presentation, and fewer than 300 reported cases in medical literature. The document emphasizes diagnostic challenges due to potential under-diagnosis of mild cases and outlines the diagnostic approach through clinical evaluation, patient history, and identification of characteristic findings.",
