  "short_description": "Clinical document describing hemimegalencephaly (HME), a rare neurological condition characterized by abnormal enlargement of one brain hemisphere causing seizures and developmental disabilities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of hemimegalencephaly (HME), a rare neurological malformation where one hemisphere of the brain is abnormally larger than the other. The document details the clinical presentation, including frequent seizures that often begin in early infancy and may present as infantile spasms, along with associated cognitive and behavioral disabilities. It explains that HME can occur as an isolated condition or as part of broader neurodevelopmental syndromes, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive evaluation when HME is detected. The document also covers diagnostic approaches, highlighting MRI as the primary imaging modality for confirmation and EEG for seizure characterization, making it a valuable resource for healthcare professionals managing patients with this rare condition.",
