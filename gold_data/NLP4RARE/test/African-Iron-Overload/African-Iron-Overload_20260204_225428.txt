A diagnosis of African iron overload is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests such as blood tests, which can reveal elevated levels of ferritin in the blood plasma. Ferritin is a protein that binds to iron and is used as an indicator of the body’s iron stores. Another test measures transferrin saturation. Transferrin is a protein involved in the transport of iron from the intestine into the bloodstream.
