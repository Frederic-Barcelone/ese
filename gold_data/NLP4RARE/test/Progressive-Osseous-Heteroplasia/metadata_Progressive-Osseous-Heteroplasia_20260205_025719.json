  "short_description": "Clinical document describing diagnostic methods for progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH), including physical examination, imaging studies, and laboratory tests.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document outlines the comprehensive diagnostic approach for progressive osseous heteroplasia (POH), a rare disorder characterized by heterotopic ossification. The document details the multi-faceted evaluation process including thorough clinical assessment, identification of characteristic physical findings, and specialized diagnostic tests. Key diagnostic modalities discussed include radiographic imaging (x-rays and roentgenograms) to visualize heterotopic bone formation with POH-specific patterns, tissue biopsy for histological confirmation, and serum alkaline phosphatase testing which may show transient elevation in some cases. The document serves as a clinical reference for healthcare providers involved in diagnosing this uncommon ossification disorder.",
