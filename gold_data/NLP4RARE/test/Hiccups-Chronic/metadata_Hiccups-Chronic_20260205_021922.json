  "title": "Chronic Hiccups: Clinical Overview and Diagnosis",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing chronic hiccups, their characteristics, duration classifications, and diagnostic considerations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of chronic hiccups, distinguishing them from typical brief hiccup episodes. It defines chronic hiccups as those persisting beyond two days, with persistent hiccups lasting up to a month and chronic cases extending even longer. The document covers the physiological mechanism involving diaphragmatic spasms and vocal cord closure, discusses the rarity of chronic cases despite universal occurrence of normal hiccups, and addresses the potential complications including exhaustion and weight loss. It also notes the male predominance of chronic hiccups and outlines the diagnostic approach involving blood tests, imaging, and laboratory studies to identify underlying causes related to autonomic nervous system disorders.",
