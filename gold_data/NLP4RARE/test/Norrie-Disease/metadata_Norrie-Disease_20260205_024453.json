  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Norrie disease, a rare X-linked genetic disorder caused by NDP gene mutations affecting primarily males.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Norrie disease, a rare X-linked genetic disorder resulting from mutations in the NDP gene. The text explains that the condition is fully expressed in males, while carrier females may occasionally display symptoms. It covers the epidemiological aspects, noting that incidence and prevalence rates are unknown but the disorder affects all ethnic groups. The document outlines the diagnostic approach, which includes detailed patient history, clinical evaluation, identification of characteristic findings, and family history assessment for X-linked inheritance patterns. Confirmation of diagnosis is achieved through molecular genetic testing to identify NDP gene mutations, with testing available through clinical laboratories.",
