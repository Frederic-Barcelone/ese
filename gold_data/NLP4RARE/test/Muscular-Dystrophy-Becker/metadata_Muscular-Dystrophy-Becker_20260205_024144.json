  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Becker muscular dystrophy, an X-linked inherited muscle wasting disease caused by DMD gene mutations affecting dystrophin protein production.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Becker muscular dystrophy, a hereditary neuromuscular disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and wasting. The document details the genetic basis of the condition, including X-linked recessive inheritance patterns and DMD gene mutations on the X chromosome that result in deficient dystrophin protein production. It covers clinical presentation, including onset typically in teens or early twenties, variable symptom severity, progressive muscle deterioration leading to wheelchair dependency, potential cardiac complications (cardiomyopathy), and possible learning disabilities. The document also outlines diagnostic approaches including physical examination, family history assessment, creatine kinase blood testing, molecular genetic testing for DMD mutations, and muscle biopsy procedures when genetic testing is inconclusive.",
