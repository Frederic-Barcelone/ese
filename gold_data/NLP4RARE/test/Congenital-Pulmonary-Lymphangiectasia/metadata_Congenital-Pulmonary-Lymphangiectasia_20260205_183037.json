  "short_description": "Clinical overview of congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia, a rare birth defect characterized by abnormally dilated lymphatic vessels in the lungs.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL), a rare developmental disorder present at birth that affects the lymphatic system within the lungs. The condition is characterized by abnormally widened lymphatic vessels that disrupt normal lymph drainage, which is crucial for immune system function and fluid balance. The document covers the pathophysiology of the lymphatic system, including its role in draining lymph fluid containing proteins, fats, and lymphocytes from tissues into the bloodstream. It discusses the epidemiological aspects, noting potential gender differences in occurrence rates, though data remains inconclusive. The document also addresses the historical context of the disorder, which was first described in medical literature in 1856, and mentions the traditionally high mortality rates associated with CPL in newborns, highlighting the severity and clinical significance of this rare condition.",
