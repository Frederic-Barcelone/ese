  "short_description": "Clinical overview of congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia, a rare birth defect characterized by abnormally dilated lymphatic vessels in the lungs.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasia (CPL), a rare developmental disorder present at birth that affects the lymphatic system within the lungs. The condition is characterized by abnormally widened lymphatic vessels in pulmonary tissue, which can impact the normal drainage of lymph fluid containing proteins, fats, and lymphocytes. The document discusses the epidemiology of CPL, noting potential gender differences in occurrence rates, though data remains inconclusive. It also addresses the historical high mortality rates associated with the condition in newborns and references the disorder's first medical description in 1856. This clinical resource serves as an educational reference for understanding this rare congenital anomaly affecting the pulmonary lymphatic system.",
