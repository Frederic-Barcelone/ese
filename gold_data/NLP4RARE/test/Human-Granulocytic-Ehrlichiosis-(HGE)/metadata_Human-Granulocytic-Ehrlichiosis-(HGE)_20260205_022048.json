  "long_description": "This document provides information about Human Granulocytic Ehrlichiosis (HGE), a rare infectious disease that belongs to the Human Ehrlichioses group. The document explains that Ehrlichioses are infectious diseases caused by bacteria in the Ehrlichia family, and identifies several forms of human ehrlichial infections including HGE, Sennetsu Fever, and Human Monocytic Ehrlichiosis (HME). While these conditions are caused by different strains of Ehrlichia bacteria, they share similar clinical presentations and symptoms, making this a valuable reference for understanding this group of tick-borne bacterial infections.",
