  "short_description": "Clinical overview of AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia, a group of autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders characterized by developmental delay, intellectual disability, and progressive motor symptoms.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of AP-4-associated hereditary spastic paraplegia (HSP), encompassing SPG47, SPG50, SPG51, and SPG52. These autosomal recessive neurodegenerative disorders are caused by mutations affecting adaptor protein complex 4 production and present with a constellation of symptoms including global developmental delay, moderate to severe intellectual disability, impaired or absent speech, microcephaly, seizures, and progressive motor dysfunction. The document emphasizes the diagnostic challenges posed by nonspecific initial presentations that may resemble other spasticity-related disorders, highlighting the importance of neuroimaging findings such as thin corpus callosum, wide lateral ventricles, and white matter changes, with definitive diagnosis requiring genetic testing.",
