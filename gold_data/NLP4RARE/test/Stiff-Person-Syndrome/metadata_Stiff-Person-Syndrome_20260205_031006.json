  "short_description": "Clinical document describing stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a rare autoimmune neurological disorder characterized by progressive muscle rigidity and painful spasms.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of stiff-person syndrome (SPS), a rare acquired neurological disorder. The document details the characteristic symptoms including progressive muscle stiffness, fluctuating rigidity, and painful muscle spasms that can be triggered by environmental stimuli. It explains the variable severity and progression of the condition, its suspected autoimmune etiology, and potential association with other autoimmune disorders. The document outlines the diagnostic approach, including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, and specific diagnostic tests such as antibody screening for GAD-65 and amphiphysin, as well as electromyography (EMG) testing to demonstrate characteristic continuous muscle motor unit firing. The text also mentions the diagnostic significance of diazepam's ability to suppress EMG abnormalities in SPS patients.",
