  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of hypothalamic hamartomas (HH), rare tumor-like malformations of the ventral hypothalamus that develop during fetal development and are present at birth. The text describes HH as non-progressive lesions that grow proportionally with normal brain development and presents two primary clinical phenotypes: central precocious puberty and epilepsy with associated neurobehavioral symptoms. The document discusses epidemiological aspects, noting the rarity of the condition with epilepsy occurring in fewer than 1 in 100,000 children and adolescents, a slight male predominance, and equal risk across ethnic groups worldwide. It emphasizes the distinction between HH and other hypothalamic region tumors, particularly noting that other tumors typically do not cause the characteristic gelastic seizures associated with HH.",
