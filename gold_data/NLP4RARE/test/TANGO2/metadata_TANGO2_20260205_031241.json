  "short_description": "A clinical overview of TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias, a rare disorder first reported in 2016 with fewer than 30 identified cases worldwide.",
  "long_description": "This document provides information about TANGO2-related metabolic encephalopathy and arrhythmias, an extremely rare genetic disorder that was first documented in medical literature in 2016. The condition affects fewer than 30 individuals worldwide according to data from the TANGO2 Research Foundation as of May 2018. The document highlights the challenges in diagnosing rare diseases, noting that they are frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, which makes it difficult to establish accurate prevalence rates in the general population. This information appears to be part of clinical research or educational material about this ultra-rare metabolic disorder.",
