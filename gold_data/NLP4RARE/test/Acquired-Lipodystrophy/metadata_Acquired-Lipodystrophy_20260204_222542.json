  "short_description": "A comprehensive overview of acquired lipodystrophy, a non-inherited condition characterized by loss of body fat in specific areas, including its various subtypes and associated metabolic complications.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a detailed examination of acquired lipodystrophy, a group of disorders involving the loss of adipose tissue that develops during an individual's lifetime rather than being inherited. The document covers the various etiologies including medication-induced, autoimmune, and idiopathic causes, and describes four main subtypes: acquired generalized lipodystrophy (Lawrence syndrome), acquired partial lipodystrophy (Barraquer-Simons syndrome), localized lipodystrophy, and HIV-associated lipodystrophy induced by highly active antiretroviral therapy. The text details the characteristic clinical presentation involving fat loss in specific body regions, associated metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and diabetes, and provides epidemiological data showing gender and ethnic distribution patterns across the different subtypes.",
