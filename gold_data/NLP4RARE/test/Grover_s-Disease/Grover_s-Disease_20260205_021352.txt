Grover's disease is a rare, transient skin disorder that consists of small, firm, raised red lesions, most often on the skin of the chest and back. Diagnosis of this disorder becomes apparent under microscopic examination when the loss of the "cement" that holds the skin cells together is observed. Over time, as the skin loses the "cement", the cells separate (lysis). Small blisters containing a watery liquid are present. These blisters tend to group and have a swollen red border around them. Grover's disease is mainly seen in males older than forty or fifty. Its cause is unknown but it is thought to be related to trauma to sun damaged skin. The exact cause of Grover’s disease is not known. It may be related to fragility of old sun-damaged skin. Some doctors feel that this skin disorder may be related to heat and sweating. There have been multiple cases of this disorder associated with such things as hot tubs, hot water bottles, electric blankets, steam baths and prolonged confinement to a bed. This theory has not been proven. At least one case of this disorder has been associated with follicle mites which are parasites. Grover’s disease is a rare skin disorder seen mainly in males over the age of forty or fifty. It has also been found in females.
