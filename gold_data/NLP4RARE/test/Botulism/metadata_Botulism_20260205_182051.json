  "short_description": "Clinical guidance on diagnosing botulism through clinical evaluation and laboratory methods including mouse bioassay and bacterial culture.",
  "long_description": "This document provides comprehensive information on the clinical diagnosis and laboratory confirmation of botulism caused by Clostridium botulinum. It outlines the diagnostic approach combining thorough clinical evaluation with detailed patient history, and describes the gold standard mouse bioassay method for detecting botulinum toxin in various specimens including serum, gastric fluid, stool, and food samples. The document also covers alternative confirmation methods through bacterial culture of C. botulinum organisms from clinical specimens, with specific applications for different types of botulism including foodborne and wound botulism.",
