  "short_description": "Clinical overview of testicular cancer epidemiology and differential diagnosis of conditions with similar presentations.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of testicular cancer, highlighting its epidemiological characteristics as an uncommon cancer representing only 1% of all male cancers, yet being the most prevalent cancer type in men aged 15-35. The document emphasizes the diagnostic challenges by detailing various conditions that can mimic testicular cancer symptoms, including testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Each differential diagnosis is clearly defined with its pathophysiology and clinical presentation, making this a valuable reference for healthcare providers in distinguishing testicular cancer from other testicular pathologies.",
