Testicular cancer is an uncommon form of cancer and accounts for only 1% of all cancers in men. However, it is the most common form of cancer in men between the ages of 15 and 35. Approximately 8,850 men are diagnosed with testicular cancer each year in the United States. A variety of conditions can cause signs and symptoms that are similar to those seen in testicular cancer. This can include testicular torsion, epididymitis, epididymoorchitis, hydrocele, varicocele, hematoma, spermatocele, and syphilitic gumma. Testicular torsion in when a testicle rotates and twists around the spermatic cord (a collection of vessels, nerves, and ducts that runs to and from the testicles). Epididymitis is inflammation of the long, narrow, tightly coiled tube (epididymis) found behind each testicle. The epididymis carries sperm from the testicle to the spermatic duct. Epididymoorchitis is inflammation of the epididymis and the testicles. Hydrocele occurs when fluid builds up in the sac that surrounds the testicle leading to swelling and heaviness or discomfort of the affected testicle. Varicocele is the abnormal enlargement of the veins within the scrotum that can cause a feeling of discomfort or pain and impair fertility. A hematoma is a collection or small mass made up of clotted blood. A spermatocele is a noncancerous (benign) cyst that forms close to a testicle. Syphilitic gumma is a small, growth that can form in some people with syphilis.
