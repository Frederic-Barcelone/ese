  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of Human T-lymphotropic Virus Type I (HTLV-I), beginning with its initial isolation in 1980 from a patient with cutaneous lymphoma. The text describes the identification of acute T-cell leukemia/lymphoma (ATL) as a distinct form of lymphoma associated with HTLV-I infection. It also covers the subsequent discovery by research groups in Martinique and Japan of the association between HTLV-I and a chronic spinal cord condition, later designated as HTLV-I associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis (HAM/TSP). The document indicates that additional conditions have been linked to HTLV infection beyond these primary associations.",
