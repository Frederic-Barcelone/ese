  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome, a rare endocrine disorder in adult females characterized by galactorrhea and amenorrhea due to hyperprolactinemia.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Ahumada-Del Castillo syndrome, a rare endocrine disorder that exclusively affects adult females. The condition is characterized by dysfunction of the pituitary and hypothalamus glands, resulting in inappropriate lactation (galactorrhea) without childbirth or nursing, and absence of menstrual periods (amenorrhea) due to anovulation. The document details the clinical presentation, noting that affected women have normal breast appearance and secondary sexual characteristics but experience infertility due to lack of ovulation. While the exact etiology remains unclear, potential causes include microscopic pituitary or hypothalamic tumors, hypothyroidism, dopamine antagonist medications, and oral contraceptive discontinuation. All cases involve hyperprolactinemia as the underlying mechanism causing the characteristic symptoms.",
