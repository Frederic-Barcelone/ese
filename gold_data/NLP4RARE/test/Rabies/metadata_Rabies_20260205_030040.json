  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of rabies, an infectious disease caused by the Neurotropic lyssavirus that affects the salivary glands and central nervous system of warm-blooded animals including humans. The document discusses transmission through infected animal saliva, the importance of immediate treatment to prevent serious complications, and the success of vaccination programs in developed countries. It includes specific epidemiological data from the United States, noting the dramatic reduction in human cases through domestic animal vaccination and stray dog elimination programs, with detailed statistics from the CDC showing only one case per year reported in the 1980s and 49 total human cases between 1960-1986, primarily from wild animal exposure rather than domestic animals.",
