  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a collection of rare inherited disorders characterized by abnormal tooth enamel formation. The text covers the epidemiology of AI, noting it affects 4,000 to 16,000 children in the United States, with detailed breakdown of inheritance patterns including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive forms. The document explains the gender distribution patterns for each type and outlines diagnostic approaches, including visual examination, family history assessment, and radiographic evaluation. It emphasizes that diagnosis can typically be made by 1-2 years of age when teeth begin to erupt, and describes the use of simple dental instruments to differentiate between AI types.",
