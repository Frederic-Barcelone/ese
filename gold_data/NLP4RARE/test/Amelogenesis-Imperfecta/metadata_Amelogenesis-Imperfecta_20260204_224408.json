  "short_description": "Clinical overview of amelogenesis imperfecta, a group of rare inherited disorders affecting tooth enamel development in children.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of amelogenesis imperfecta (AI), a collection of rare inherited disorders characterized by abnormal tooth enamel formation. The document covers the epidemiology, noting that AI affects approximately 1 in 14,000 to 16,000 children in the United States, with detailed information about different inheritance patterns including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive forms. It explains the gender distribution patterns for each type and outlines the diagnostic approach, which typically involves visual examination, family history assessment, and X-ray examination when teeth erupt. The document emphasizes that diagnosis can be made as early as one to two years of age using simple clinical tools.",
