  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Conradi-Hünermann syndrome, a rare genetic disorder classified as a form of chondrodysplasia punctata. The document details the characteristic features including skeletal malformations with stippled epiphyses, disproportionate shortening of long bones, spinal curvature, and growth deficiency leading to short stature. It also describes associated symptoms such as distinctive facial features including prominent forehead and midfacial hypoplasia, cataracts, sparse coarse hair, and skin abnormalities including thickening, dryness, and scaling. The document emphasizes the variable presentation of symptoms and notes the X-linked dominant inheritance pattern that predominantly affects females.",
