  "short_description": "Clinical document describing dextrocardia with situs inversus, a rare congenital heart condition where the heart apex is positioned on the right side with reversed organ positioning.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of dextrocardia with situs inversus, a rare congenital heart condition present at birth. The document explains the anatomical characteristics of this condition, including the abnormal right-sided positioning of the heart apex and the complete reversal of visceral organs (situs inversus). It covers diagnostic approaches using electrocardiography, discusses the generally favorable prognosis for most patients who can live normal lives without symptoms, and addresses treatment considerations which are typically symptomatic and supportive. The document also notes equal prevalence between males and females and mentions the importance of genetic counseling for affected families, while acknowledging that prognosis may vary when associated with other serious cardiac malformations.",
