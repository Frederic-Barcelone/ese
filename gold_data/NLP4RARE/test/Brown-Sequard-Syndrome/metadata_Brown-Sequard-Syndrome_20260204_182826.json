  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Brown-Séquard syndrome, a rare neurological condition resulting from incomplete injury to one side of the spinal cord. The text details the etiology, typically involving puncture wounds to the cervical or thoracic spine regions, and presents epidemiological data showing equal gender distribution and an incidence rate of approximately 2% of all traumatic spinal cord injuries. With over 500 documented cases and an estimated annual incidence within the broader context of spinal cord injuries affecting 30-40 per million people, this resource serves as an important reference for understanding this uncommon but clinically significant neurological disorder.",
