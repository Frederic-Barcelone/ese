  "short_description": "A clinical document detailing the prevalence and incidence rates of adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, an extremely rare neurological disorder.",
  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological data on adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ANCL), a group of extremely rare neurodegenerative disorders. The content focuses on statistical measures of disease occurrence, including prevalence estimates of approximately 1.5 per 9 million people in the general population and incidence rates ranging from 1.5-7 per 100,000 live births, with variations observed across different countries. The document serves as a reference for understanding the rarity and distribution patterns of these inherited lysosomal storage disorders that affect the nervous system.",
