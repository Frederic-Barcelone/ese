  "short_description": "A clinical document detailing the prevalence and incidence rates of adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses, an extremely rare neurological disorder.",
  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological data on adult neuronal ceroid lipofuscinoses (ANCL), a group of extremely rare neurodegenerative disorders. The content focuses on statistical measures of disease occurrence, reporting a prevalence of approximately 1.5 per 9 million people in the general population. The document also discusses incidence rates, which vary by geographic region and range from 1.5 to 7 cases per 100,000 live births. The text includes clear definitions of epidemiological terms, distinguishing between prevalence (total existing cases at a given time) and incidence (new cases born per year), making it a valuable reference for understanding the rarity and distribution of this neurological condition.",
