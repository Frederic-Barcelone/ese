  "short_description": "Clinical document describing hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare life-threatening immune system disorder with primary and secondary forms.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH), a rare and potentially fatal condition characterized by an overactive and abnormal immune system response. The document explains the pathophysiology of HLH as an ineffective immune response to triggers, often infections, and distinguishes between primary (familial/genetic) and secondary (acquired) forms of the disease. It covers the epidemiological aspects, noting that while HLH most commonly affects infants and young children from birth to 18 months, it can occur at any age with equal gender distribution in children and slight male predominance in adults. The document emphasizes the critical importance of early diagnosis and prompt treatment, while acknowledging the challenges in determining true prevalence due to frequent misdiagnosis of this rare disorder.",
