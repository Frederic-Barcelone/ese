  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of Trisomy X, a chromosomal disorder that exclusively affects females. The condition occurs in approximately one in 1,000 female births, though frequency estimates vary across studies. A significant challenge in understanding this disorder is its underdiagnosis, as many affected females present with few or no symptoms and may never receive a formal diagnosis. Researchers estimate that only about 10 percent of individuals with Trisomy X are actually diagnosed, suggesting the true prevalence may be much higher than reported in medical literature. The document emphasizes the need for increased detection methods to enable more comprehensive studies and ensure appropriate treatment for affected girls.",
