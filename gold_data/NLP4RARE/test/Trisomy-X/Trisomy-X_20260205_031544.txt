Trisomy X is a chromosomal disorder that affects only females. Reported estimates of frequency have varied with the most common estimate being one in 1,000 female births. Because many females with the disorder may have few or no symptoms, they may never be diagnosed. Researchers believe that the disorder is underdiagnosed and that the reported number of affected females as reflected in the medical literature is inappropriately low. Researchers believe that only approximately 10 percent of affected individuals are diagnosed. With increased detection, more in depth studies may be conducted and more girls with trisomy X can be appropriately treated.
