Mucopolysaccharidosis type | affects males and females in equal numbers, with an incidence of about 1 in 100,000 live births for the severe type, and an incidence of about 1in 500,000 live births for the attenuated type. Incidence is the number of people who develop a disorder over a given period of time (e.g. one year). The incidence for MPS disorders collectively is about 1 in 25,000. However, rare disorders, especially milder forms of MPS, often go misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency in the general population.
