  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological data on Mucopolysaccharidosis Type I (MPS I), a rare genetic disorder. The document outlines that MPS I affects males and females equally, with the severe form occurring in approximately 1 in 100,000 live births and the attenuated form in about 1 in 500,000 live births. It also discusses the collective incidence of all MPS disorders at approximately 1 in 25,000 births and addresses the challenges in determining accurate prevalence due to misdiagnosis and underdiagnosis of milder forms of the condition.",
