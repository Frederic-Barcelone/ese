  "short_description": "Clinical document explaining immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by low platelet counts and its diagnostic challenges.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), an autoimmune bleeding disorder that results in abnormally low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia). The document explains the role of platelets in maintaining blood vessel integrity and preventing bleeding through clotting mechanisms. It establishes diagnostic criteria, noting that ITP is typically diagnosed when platelet counts fall below 100,000 per microliter without other identifiable causes. The document emphasizes that ITP is a diagnosis of exclusion, as there is no definitive laboratory test available, and discusses the variability in diagnostic approaches among healthcare providers and the challenges in establishing standardized testing protocols.",
