  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Kearns-Sayre syndrome (KSS), a rare neuromuscular disorder. The text details the primary diagnostic features including chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO), atypical retinitis pigmentosa with pigmentary retinal degeneration, and cardiomyopathy with potential heart block. Additional clinical manifestations discussed include ptosis, muscle weakness, short stature, hearing loss, and cerebellar ataxia. The document serves as a clinical reference for understanding the multisystem nature of this mitochondrial disorder and its varied presentations in affected patients.",
