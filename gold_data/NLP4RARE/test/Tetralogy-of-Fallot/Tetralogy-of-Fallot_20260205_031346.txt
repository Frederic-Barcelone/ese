The diagnosis of tetralogy of Fallot is confirmed by clinical evaluation and physical examination. A variety of specialized tests including electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization may be performed to aid in diagnosis and therapy. When tetralogy of Fallot is present, x-ray studies usually reveal a normal-sized heart that is characteristically boot-shaped (coeur en sabot). Periodic measurements of systemic blood oxygen saturation and hemoglobin are also advisable. Infants with this disorder usually have a relatively loud murmur over the upper left breastbone.
