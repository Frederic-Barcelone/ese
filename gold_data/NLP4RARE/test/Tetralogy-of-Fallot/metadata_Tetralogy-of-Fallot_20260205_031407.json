  "short_description": "Clinical document describing diagnostic methods and physical examination findings for tetralogy of Fallot, a congenital heart defect.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document outlines the comprehensive diagnostic approach for tetralogy of Fallot, a complex congenital heart condition. It details the various diagnostic modalities including clinical evaluation, physical examination, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, and cardiac catheterization. The document highlights key diagnostic features such as the characteristic boot-shaped heart appearance on x-ray studies (coeur en sabot), the presence of loud murmurs over the upper left breastbone in infants, and the importance of monitoring systemic blood oxygen saturation and hemoglobin levels. This information serves as a clinical reference for healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis and management of this congenital cardiac anomaly.",
