  "short_description": "Clinical document describing seborrheic keratosis, a benign skin disorder characterized by 'stuck-on' lesions that commonly appear in middle age.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of seborrheic keratosis, a common benign skin condition characterized by discolored, waxy lesions that appear 'stuck on' the skin surface. The document covers the clinical presentation, including the characteristic appearance of tan to black, round or oval lesions that may occur on the trunk, back, and shoulders. It discusses the unknown etiology with possible genetic inheritance patterns, the predominant occurrence in middle-aged individuals, and the benign nature of the condition. The document details various treatment modalities including curettage, electrodesiccation, cryotherapy, chemical peels, and dermabrasion, emphasizing that treatment is primarily for cosmetic or comfort reasons rather than medical necessity.",
