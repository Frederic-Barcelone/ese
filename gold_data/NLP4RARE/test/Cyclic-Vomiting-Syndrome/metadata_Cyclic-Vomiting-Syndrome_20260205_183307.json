  "title": "Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome: Clinical Overview and Diagnostic Criteria",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing cyclic vomiting syndrome (CVS), its demographics, prevalence, and diagnostic approaches in pediatric and adult populations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome (CVS), a disorder that affects approximately 2% of Caucasian school-aged children with a slight female predominance. The document covers the historical background of CVS, first described in medical literature in 1806, and discusses its occurrence across age groups from early infancy to old age. It addresses the challenges in diagnosis due to frequent misdiagnosis as stomach flu, leading to delayed recognition. The text outlines current diagnostic criteria based on consensus from the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition and the Rome IV Committee, emphasizing that CVS diagnosis requires ruling out other causes of recurrent vomiting through various clinical tests and evaluations.",
