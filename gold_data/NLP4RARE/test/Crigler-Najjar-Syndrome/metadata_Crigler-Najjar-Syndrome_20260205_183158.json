  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides epidemiological information about Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. The document details that the condition affects both males and females equally, with an estimated incidence of 1 in 750,000 to 1,000,000 people in the general population. It highlights significant diagnostic challenges in the medical community, noting that the disorder is frequently undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, which complicates accurate prevalence determination. The document suggests that the true frequency of Crigler-Najjar syndrome may be higher than current estimates indicate, emphasizing the need for improved diagnostic awareness and recognition among healthcare professionals.",
