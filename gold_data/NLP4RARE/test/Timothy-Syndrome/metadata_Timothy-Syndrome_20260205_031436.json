  "title": "Timothy Syndrome: A Rare Genetic Disorder Affecting Heart and Multiple Organs",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Timothy syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by prolonged cardiac repolarization, arrhythmias, and multi-organ involvement with high mortality rates.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Timothy syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder that primarily affects cardiac function through abnormally prolonged QT intervals, leading to life-threatening arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death. Unlike other long QT syndromes, Timothy syndrome presents with additional cardiac complications including structural malformations, hypertrophy, and dilatation. The document emphasizes the disorder's complexity, extremely low prevalence worldwide, high mortality rate, and limited reproductive success among affected individuals, making it one of the most challenging genetic cardiac conditions to study and manage.",
