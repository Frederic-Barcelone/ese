  "short_description": "A clinical document describing hydrocephalus, a condition characterized by abnormal accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid in the brain's ventricles causing increased intracranial pressure.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of hydrocephalus, a neurological condition involving the abnormal widening of cerebral ventricles and impaired cerebrospinal fluid flow. The document explains the pathophysiology of CSF accumulation and resulting brain tissue compression, discusses diagnostic considerations including enlarged head circumference in infants and increased intracranial pressure, and outlines the various classifications of hydrocephalus including communicating, non-communicating (obstructive), internal, normal pressure, and benign forms. It also addresses epidemiological aspects such as age of onset, with most cases diagnosed within the first two years of life, and notes the generally equal gender distribution except for X-linked genetic variants.",
