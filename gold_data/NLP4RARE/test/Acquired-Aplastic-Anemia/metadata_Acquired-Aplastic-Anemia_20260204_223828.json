  "short_description": "Clinical overview of acquired aplastic anemia covering epidemiological patterns, diagnostic criteria, and testing procedures including bone marrow biopsy.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of acquired aplastic anemia, detailing its epidemiological characteristics including equal gender distribution and higher prevalence in Asia compared to Europe and Israel. It explains the diagnostic approach for this condition, which typically presents as pancytopenia in otherwise healthy individuals, particularly affecting older children, teenagers, and young adults. The text outlines the diagnostic process involving clinical evaluation, patient history, and specialized testing procedures, with particular emphasis on bone marrow biopsy as a confirmatory test that reveals dramatic reduction or absence of bone marrow cells. The document also addresses the importance of differential diagnosis to exclude other conditions such as leukemia and to determine potential inherited or genetic causes.",
