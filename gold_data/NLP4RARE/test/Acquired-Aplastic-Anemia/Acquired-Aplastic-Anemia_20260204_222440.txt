Acquired aplastic anemia affects males and females in about equal numbers. Most cases affect older children, teenagers or young adults. The incidence of aplastic anemia in Europe and Israel is two new cases among 1 million people per year. The incidence rate is two or three times greater in Asia. The exact incidence rates exist for the United States is unknown although some sources say that approximately 500-1,000 new cases of aplastic anemia are diagnosed each year. A diagnosis of acquired aplastic anemia may be suspected when an otherwise healthy individual has low levels of all three blood cell types (pancytopenia). A diagnosis may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, a detailed patient history, anda variety of specialized tests, including a bone marrow biopsy. During this procedure, a small specimen of bone marrow tissue is surgically removed, usually from the hip or pelvis, and studied under a microscope. In acquired aplastic anemia this sample will show a dramatic reduction or complete lack of cells. Additional tests may be necessary to rule out other disorders such as leukemia and to determine if there is an inherited or genetic cause.
