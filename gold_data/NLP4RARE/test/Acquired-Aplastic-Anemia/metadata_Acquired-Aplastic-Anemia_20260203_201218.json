  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of acquired aplastic anemia, detailing its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic approach. It covers the equal gender distribution of the condition, its predominant occurrence in older children, teenagers, and young adults, and regional incidence variations with rates of 2 per million annually in Europe and Israel, and 2-3 times higher in Asia. The document outlines the diagnostic process, emphasizing the identification of pancytopenia in otherwise healthy individuals and the confirmation through bone marrow biopsy, which reveals dramatic cellular reduction. It also addresses the importance of differential diagnosis to exclude conditions like leukemia and determine potential inherited causes.",
