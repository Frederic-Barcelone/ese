  "short_description": "Clinical document describing BAM syndrome, an extremely rare genetic disorder affecting fewer than 100 reported cases worldwide.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides an overview of Bosma-Arhinia-Microphthalmia (BAM) syndrome, a rare genetic disorder characterized by the absence or underdevelopment of the nose (arhinia) and small eyes (microphthalmia). The document discusses the epidemiological challenges associated with this condition, noting that it affects patients across diverse ethnic groups but remains significantly underdiagnosed. With fewer than 100 documented cases in medical literature, the true prevalence and incidence of BAM syndrome in the general population remains unknown, highlighting the need for increased awareness and improved diagnostic capabilities for this rare disorder.",
