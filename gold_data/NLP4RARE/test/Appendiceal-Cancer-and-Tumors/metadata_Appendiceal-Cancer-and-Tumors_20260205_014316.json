  "short_description": "Clinical document providing comprehensive information about appendiceal cancer epidemiology, peritoneal carcinomatosis, and diagnostic approaches for rare appendiceal tumors.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document presents detailed information about appendiceal cancer, a rare malignancy affecting 1-2 cases per million individuals with peak incidence in the sixth decade of life. The document covers the epidemiology showing equal gender distribution, discusses peritoneal carcinomatosis as a common complication involving cancer spread throughout the abdominal cavity, and explains the diagnostic challenges associated with appendiceal tumors. It emphasizes that definitive diagnosis requires pathological examination since imaging studies cannot uniquely identify appendiceal cancer, and describes various tumor types including goblet cell carcinoid tumors that can be distinguished through microscopic examination and specific cellular markers.",
