  "title": "Dyskeratosis Congenita: A Rare Genetic Bone Marrow Failure Syndrome",
  "short_description": "Clinical overview of dyskeratosis congenita, a rare genetic disorder causing bone marrow failure with characteristic skin, nail, and oral manifestations.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of dyskeratosis congenita, a rare genetic form of bone marrow failure first described in 1906. Originally misidentified as primarily a skin disease, it is now understood as a complex syndrome characterized by the classic triad of abnormal skin changes, nail dystrophy, and oral leukoplakia, along with bone marrow's inability to produce sufficient blood cells. The document details the historical evolution of understanding this condition, its diverse clinical manifestations including short stature, organ abnormalities, and increased cancer risk, and its prevalence in bone marrow failure and pulmonary fibrosis patient populations. It emphasizes the importance of considering dyskeratosis congenita in families with increased frequency of bone marrow failure and lung disease.",
