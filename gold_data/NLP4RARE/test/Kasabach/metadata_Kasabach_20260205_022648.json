  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, a rare life-threatening condition characterized by coagulopathy associated with specific vascular tumors in infants.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP), a rare and potentially life-threatening condition that occurs exclusively with kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas. The document details the pathophysiology involving profound thrombocytopenia, hypofibrinogenemia, and anemia due to platelet sequestration within abnormal vascular tumors. It covers clinical presentation including skin lesions, petechiae, and bleeding risks, predominantly affecting infants under three months of age. The text explains the diagnostic approach using laboratory studies (CBC, coagulation studies) and imaging (MRI with contrast), while emphasizing the distinction from hemangiomas and the potential for progression to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy. The document serves as an educational resource for healthcare providers managing this complex vascular disorder.",
