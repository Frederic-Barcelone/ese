  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of nemaline myopathy, a rare genetic disorder that affects skeletal muscle function in both males and females. The document details the epidemiological data showing varying incidence rates across different populations, from 1 in 50,000 live births in general populations to higher rates in specific communities like the Amish (1/500). It outlines the diagnostic approach which relies on thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient and family history, and identification of characteristic findings. The document emphasizes two key diagnostic methods: muscle biopsy revealing characteristic thread-like or rod-like structures (nemaline bodies) when stained with Gomori trichrome, and increasingly, molecular genetic testing for mutations in genes known to cause the condition.",
