Paget’s disease is rarely diagnosed in people under the age of 40 years but may occur in up to eight percent of the population over the age of 60 years. Paget’s disease affects individuals of all ethnic and racial groups. However, it affects individuals of Asian descent less frequently. Both men and women are affected with a slight male predominance. The prevalence of Paget's disease in the United States is estimated to be 1-2 percent of the general population. The diagnosis of Paget’s disease may be confirmed by a thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and a variety of specialized tests, such as blood tests, x-rays, and urine tests. A blood test may reveal elevated levels of the enzyme alkaline phosphatase suggesting the diagnosis of Paget’s disease. A bone scan or x-ray may also be used to determine abnormalities in the bones. Urine tests, such as pyrilinks and osteomark, may also be used to assist in the diagnosis of Paget’s disease.
