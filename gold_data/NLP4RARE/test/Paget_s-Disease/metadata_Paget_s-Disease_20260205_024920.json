  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Paget's disease, focusing on its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic methodologies. It details the age-related prevalence patterns, showing the disease rarely occurs before age 40 but affects up to 8% of individuals over 60. The text covers demographic variations across ethnic groups, with lower prevalence in Asian populations, and notes a slight male predominance. The document outlines the estimated 1-2% prevalence in the US population and describes the multi-faceted diagnostic approach, including clinical evaluation, patient history, and specialized testing such as alkaline phosphatase blood tests, bone scans, x-rays, and urine markers like pyrilinks and osteomark.",
