  "long_description": "This document provides an overview of Hyperlipoproteinemia Type III, a rare genetic disorder affecting 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000 people. The condition is characterized by the body's inability to properly metabolize fats (lipids), resulting in hyperlipidemia and the formation of characteristic yellow skin growths called xanthomas. The disorder significantly increases the risk of atherosclerosis, where fatty materials accumulate in blood vessels, potentially blocking blood flow and leading to serious cardiovascular complications including heart attack and stroke. Without proper treatment, affected individuals face a 5-10 times higher risk of developing cardiovascular disease compared to the general population.",
