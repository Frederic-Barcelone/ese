Hyperlipoproteinemia type III is a genetic disorder that causes the body to breakdown (metabolize) fats (lipids) incorrectly. This results in the buildup of lipids in the body (hyperlipidemia) and can lead to the development of multiple small, yellow skin growths (xanthomas). Affected individuals may also develop the buildup of fatty materials in the blood vessels (atherosclerosis) blocking blood flow and potentially leading to heart attack or stroke. Hyperlipoproteinemia type III affects 1-5,000 to 1 in 10,000 people in the general population. Without treatment, affected individuals are 5-10 times more likely to develop cardiovascular disease.
