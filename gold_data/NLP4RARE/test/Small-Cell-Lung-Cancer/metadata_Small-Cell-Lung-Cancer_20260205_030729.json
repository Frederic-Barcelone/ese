  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological data on small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in the United States, highlighting the declining incidence over the past two decades attributed to reduced smoking rates. It presents key statistics showing that SCLC represents 10-15% of all lung cancer cases, with approximately 30,000-35,000 new diagnoses annually. The document emphasizes the strong causal relationship between smoking and SCLC development, noting that the disease is extremely rare among never-smokers and that virtually all SCLC patients have a smoking history.",
