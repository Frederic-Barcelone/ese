Lung cancer, as a group, is the second most common form of cancer in the United States. SCLC accounts for about 10%-15% of people who have lung cancer. There are about 30,000 to 35,000 new people diagnosed with SCLC each year in the United States. Almost everyone who develops SCLC has a history of smoking. It is extremely rare in individuals who have never smoked.",
