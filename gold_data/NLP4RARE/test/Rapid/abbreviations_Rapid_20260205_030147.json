Therefore, as ROHHAD is a relatively “new” disorder without many cases identified thus far, it is not yet clear if any certain population is at greater risk for developing ROHHAD. Because of the explosion of exogenous obesity worldwide, a very high level of vigilance in consideration of ROHHAD is essential. Congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) is a disorder of the ANS caused by a gene mutation in the PHOX2B gene that affects the embryologic development of the ANS. Similar to ROHHAD, the “automatic” control of breathing, heart -beat, digestion, and other features of ANSD are among the affected features.

CCHS is a rare disorder with approximately 1,000 cases described worldwide. Numbers of reported CCHS cases continue to grow, likely because of increased awareness and introduction of a clinically available genetic test (in 2003) — allowing for early diagnosis and improved treatment.
