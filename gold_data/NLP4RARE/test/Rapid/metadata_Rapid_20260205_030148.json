  "title": "ROHHAD and CCHS: Respiratory and Autonomic Disorders Clinical Overview",
  "short_description": "Clinical document describing ROHHAD (Rapid-onset Obesity with Hypothalamic dysfunction, Hypoventilation, and Autonomic Dysregulation) and CCHS (Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome), two rare disorders affecting respiratory control and autonomic nervous system function.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of two rare respiratory and autonomic disorders: ROHHAD and CCHS. It details the pathophysiology, clinical presentation, and diagnostic criteria for both conditions, emphasizing their impact on respiratory control, autonomic nervous system regulation, and endocrine function. The document explains that ROHHAD is a newly recognized disorder with approximately 100 reported cases, characterized by rapid-onset obesity, hypothalamic dysfunction, hypoventilation, and autonomic dysregulation, while CCHS is caused by PHOX2B gene mutations affecting approximately 1,000 cases worldwide. Both disorders fall under the category of respiratory and autonomic disorders of infancy, childhood, and adulthood (RADICA), with the document highlighting the importance of early recognition, genetic testing for CCHS, and the need for increased clinical vigilance given the rising prevalence of obesity.",
