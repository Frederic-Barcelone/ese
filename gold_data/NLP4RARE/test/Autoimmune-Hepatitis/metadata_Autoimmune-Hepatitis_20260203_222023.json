  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), a rare liver disorder with distinct demographic patterns and clinical presentations. It details the gender distribution showing a 4:1 female predominance, describes the two main types with Type 1 being more common in adults and Type 2 more severe in children, and discusses variant forms that overlap with other autoimmune liver diseases. The document also presents current epidemiological data showing an incidence of 1-2 per 100,000 new cases annually and a prevalence of 24 per 100,000, while noting an unexplained increasing trend in AIH incidence.",
