  "short_description": "Clinical overview of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency, a rare inherited metabolic disorder characterized by enzyme deficiency and distinctive neurological symptoms.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of adenylosuccinate lyase deficiency (ASLD), a rare inherited metabolic disorder caused by deficiency of the enzyme adenylosuccinate lyase. The condition is characterized by the presence of two abnormal compounds (SAICA riboside and succinyladenosine) in cerebrospinal fluid and urine that are never found in healthy individuals. The document details the variable clinical presentation, which typically includes neurological symptoms such as psychomotor retardation, autistic features, epilepsy, muscle tone abnormalities, and feeding difficulties. It also describes the less common dysmorphic features that may be present, including growth failure, microcephaly, and various facial abnormalities. This clinical reference serves as a diagnostic and educational resource for healthcare professionals managing patients with this rare metabolic condition.",
