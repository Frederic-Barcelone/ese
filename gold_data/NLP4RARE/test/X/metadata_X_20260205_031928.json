  "short_description": "Clinical description of XMEA, a rare X-linked genetic disorder causing progressive muscle weakness primarily in males.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA), an extremely rare genetic disorder that affects muscle function. The condition is characterized by slowly progressive muscle weakness, particularly in the legs, with typical onset during childhood between ages 5-10 years. The disorder follows an X-linked recessive inheritance pattern, meaning it is fully expressed only in males. The document outlines the genetic basis involving mutations in an unidentified gene on the X chromosome, clinical presentation, and diagnostic approaches including clinical evaluation, patient history assessment, and muscle biopsy for microscopic examination.",
