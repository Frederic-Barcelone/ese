  "short_description": "A comprehensive clinical guide covering the diagnosis, characteristics, and modern understanding of leprosy as a treatable infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a thorough overview of leprosy (Hansen's disease), addressing both historical misconceptions and current medical understanding. The text emphasizes that leprosy is a chronic infectious disease caused by Mycobacterium leprae that is now completely treatable and curable, eliminating any justification for patient isolation. The document details key diagnostic criteria including sensory loss in skin lesions, nerve enlargement and tenderness, numbness in extremities, and bacterial identification through skin smears. It explains the diagnostic process across different disease classifications, noting that skin smears are effective for lepromatous and borderline lepromatous cases, while skin biopsies may be necessary for tuberculoid cases where bacterial counts are too low for smear detection.",
