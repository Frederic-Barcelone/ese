  "long_description": "This document provides an overview of fetal retinoid syndrome, a serious teratogenic condition characterized by congenital malformations resulting from maternal exposure to retinoids during pregnancy. The syndrome affects both males and females equally and presents with a spectrum of mental and physical birth defects. While the absolute risk following oral isotretinoin therapy remains unclear, prospective studies indicate malformation rates between 5% and 20% in live-born infants. The document highlights the diagnostic challenges associated with this condition, noting that many cases go unrecognized, leading to under-diagnosis and difficulty in establishing the true prevalence in the general population.",
