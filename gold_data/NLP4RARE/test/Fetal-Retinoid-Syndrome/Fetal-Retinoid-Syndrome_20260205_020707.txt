Fetal retinoid syndrome is a pattern of mental and physical birth defects (congenital malformations) that can result from a mother taking retinoids during pregnancy. The absolute risk of congenital malformations following oral isotretinoin therapy is currently unclear. Overall malformation rates in live-born infants from prospectively reported pregnancies range from 5% to 20%. Fetal retinoid syndrome affects males and females in equal numbers. The exact incidence of fetal retinoid syndrome is unknown and because many children with fetal retinoid syndrome often go unrecognized. The disorder is under-diagnosed, making it difficult to determine the true frequency of the disorder in the general population.
