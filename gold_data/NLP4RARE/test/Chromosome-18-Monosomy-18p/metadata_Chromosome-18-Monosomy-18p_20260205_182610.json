  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p, a rare chromosomal disorder involving partial or complete deletion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18. The document details the characteristic clinical features including short stature, variable intellectual disability, speech delays, and distinctive craniofacial abnormalities such as microcephaly, broad flat nose, carp-shaped mouth, and protruding ears. It discusses the rare association with holoprosencephaly (occurring in approximately 10% of cases), which can result in severe midline facial defects and neurological complications. The document also presents epidemiological data, noting a female predominance (3:2 ratio), advanced parental age at conception, and reports of over 120 documented cases since the condition's initial description in 1963.",
