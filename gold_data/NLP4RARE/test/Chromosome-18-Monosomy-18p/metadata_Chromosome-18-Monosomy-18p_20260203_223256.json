  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of Chromosome 18, Monosomy 18p, a rare chromosomal disorder involving deletion of all or part of the short arm (p) of chromosome 18. The text details the characteristic clinical features including short stature, intellectual disability, speech delays, and distinctive craniofacial abnormalities such as microcephaly, broad flat nose, carp-shaped mouth, and protruding ears. The document also discusses the rare association with holoprosencephaly (occurring in ~10% of cases), which can cause severe midline facial defects and neurological complications. Epidemiological information is provided, noting a female predominance (3:2 ratio), advanced parental age, and over 120 reported cases since the condition's initial description in 1963.",
