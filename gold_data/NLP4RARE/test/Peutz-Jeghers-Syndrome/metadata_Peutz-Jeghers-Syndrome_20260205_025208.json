  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (PJS), a rare genetic disorder that affects both males and females equally across all racial and ethnic groups. The document outlines the birth prevalence estimates ranging from 1/50,000 to 1/200,000, with potential higher prevalence in specific countries like the Netherlands and China. It emphasizes the gender-specific cancer risks associated with PJS, noting that women face elevated risks for developing breast, ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancers compared to men with the condition.",
