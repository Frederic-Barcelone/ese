Peutz Jeghers syndrome is a rare disorder that affects males and females in equal numbers and can occur in any racial or ethnic group. The birth prevalence of PUS is estimated to be between 1/50,000 and 1/200,000. Limited evidence shows that the disease might be more prevalent in certain countries such as the Netherlands and China. Women are at a higher risk of developing cancer compared to men, as PJS increases the likelihood of developing breast, ovarian, cervical, and uterine cancer.
