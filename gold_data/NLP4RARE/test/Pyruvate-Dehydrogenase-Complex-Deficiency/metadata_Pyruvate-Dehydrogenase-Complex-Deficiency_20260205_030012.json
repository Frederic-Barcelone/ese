  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency (PDCD), a rare metabolic disorder. The document details the progressive neurological symptoms that typically begin in infancy, including motor delays, seizures, and coordination problems. It describes different onset forms of the condition, from prenatal to early childhood, and explains the gender-related differences in disease severity. The document also covers biochemical abnormalities such as lactic acidosis and elevated alanine levels, diagnostic approaches including neuroimaging and enzyme testing, and the overall clinical presentation that healthcare providers should recognize for proper diagnosis and management.",
