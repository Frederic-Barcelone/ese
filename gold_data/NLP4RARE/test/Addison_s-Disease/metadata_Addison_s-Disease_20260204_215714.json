  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about Addison's disease, a rare endocrine disorder. It details the disease's equal prevalence between males and females, affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 people in the United States with an overall prevalence of 40-60 cases per million population. The document discusses the typical age of onset (30-50 years), challenges in diagnosis that may lead to underreporting, and provides historical context noting the disease was first identified by physician Thomas Addison in 1855. This information is valuable for healthcare professionals and researchers understanding the demographic patterns and frequency of this adrenal insufficiency condition.",
