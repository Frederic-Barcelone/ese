  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an epidemiological overview of CHARGE syndrome, a rare congenital disorder that affects approximately 0.1-1.2 per 10,000 live births globally. The document outlines key characteristics including equal prevalence between males and females, occurrence across all racial groups and continents, and the progressive nature of symptom manifestation from birth through years of development. It addresses diagnostic challenges, noting that many cases remain misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, particularly in children with milder presentations. The document also provides important genetic counseling information regarding recurrence risks for families, distinguishing between the low 2-3% risk for parents with one affected child versus the significantly higher 50% risk for adults with CHARGE syndrome having children.",
