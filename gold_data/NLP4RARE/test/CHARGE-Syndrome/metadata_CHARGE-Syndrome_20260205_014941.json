  "long_description": "This clinical document presents key epidemiological and diagnostic information about CHARGE syndrome, a rare congenital disorder with an incidence of 0.1-1.2 per 10,000 live births. The document discusses the equal gender distribution, global prevalence across all races and continents, and challenges in diagnosis including underdiagnosis and misdiagnosis. It emphasizes the variable presentation of symptoms, with some features apparent at birth while others may not manifest for years. The document also provides important genetic counseling information regarding recurrence risks for families, noting a 2-3% risk for parents with one affected child and up to 50% risk for affected adults having children.",
