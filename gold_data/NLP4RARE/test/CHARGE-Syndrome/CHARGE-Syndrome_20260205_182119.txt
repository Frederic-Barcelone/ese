CHARGE syndrome is a rare disorder, affecting 0.1-1.2/10,000 live births. It affects males and females in equal numbers and has been seen in all races and on every continent. There are far more cases of CHARGE than those described in the medical literature. Many cases are misdiagnosed or undiagnosed, especially in children with fewer problems. Although many features of CHARGE are apparent at birth, some features will not become apparent for weeks, months, or perhaps years later. The recurrence risk of CHARGE for parents with one affected child is low, around 2-3 percent. The recurrence risk for an adult with CHARGE to have an affected child may be as high as 50 percent.
