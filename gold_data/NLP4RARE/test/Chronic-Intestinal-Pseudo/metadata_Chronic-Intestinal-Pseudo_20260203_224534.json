  "long_description": "This document provides epidemiological information about chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (CIP), a rare gastrointestinal disorder that affects males and females equally across all age groups. The text discusses the challenges in determining accurate prevalence due to frequent misdiagnosis and underrecognition, noting approximately 100 new pediatric cases reported annually in the United States. It distinguishes between primary CIP, which predominantly affects children in sporadic, non-familial forms, and secondary CIP, which more commonly occurs in adults as a consequence of systemic diseases including scleroderma, diabetes, and paraneoplastic syndromes.",
