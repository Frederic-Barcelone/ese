  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of acrodysostosis, focusing on its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic considerations. The text explains that acrodysostosis is a congenital disorder that affects males and females equally, though it may not become apparent until years after birth. The document highlights significant challenges in determining the true prevalence of this condition due to frequent misdiagnosis or lack of diagnosis, making it difficult to establish accurate incidence rates in the general population. This information is valuable for healthcare professionals seeking to understand the demographic patterns and diagnostic complexities associated with acrodysostosis.",
