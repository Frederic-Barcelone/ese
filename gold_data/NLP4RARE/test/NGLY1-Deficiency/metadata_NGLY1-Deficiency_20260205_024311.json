  "long_description": "This document provides essential information about NGLY1 deficiency, an extremely rare genetic disorder that was first documented in medical literature in 2012. The condition affects a very small population, with the NGLY1 Foundation reporting approximately 63 identified individuals worldwide as of January 2018. The document highlights the challenges associated with rare diseases, particularly the tendency for NGLY1 deficiency to be undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, which complicates efforts to determine its true prevalence in the general population. This information serves as a foundational resource for understanding the rarity and diagnostic challenges associated with this genetic condition.",
