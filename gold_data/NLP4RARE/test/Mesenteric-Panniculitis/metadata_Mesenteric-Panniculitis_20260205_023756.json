  "short_description": "Clinical overview of mesenteric panniculitis covering its epidemiological characteristics, patient demographics, and differential diagnostic considerations.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical analysis of mesenteric panniculitis, a rare inflammatory condition affecting the mesentery. It presents epidemiological data showing the condition occurs in approximately 0.24% of abdominal CT examinations, with notable associations to malignancy in 28% of cases. The text details demographic patterns including male predominance (2:1 ratio) and peak incidence in the sixth and seventh decades of life. The document emphasizes the diagnostic challenges posed by mesenteric panniculitis due to its symptom overlap with various benign and malignant conditions, providing a detailed differential diagnosis list that includes infectious causes, malignancies, inflammatory conditions, and other mesenteric abnormalities that must be excluded before confirming the diagnosis.",
