  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome, a rare congenital disorder characterized by underdevelopment of the uterus and vagina in women with otherwise normal ovarian function and external genitalia. The document details the clinical presentation including primary amenorrhea despite normal secondary sexual characteristics, and distinguishes between Type I (isolated) and Type II (with additional organ system abnormalities affecting kidneys and skeleton). It emphasizes the psychological impact of the condition and the importance of counseling support. The document also presents an update on current genetic research, highlighting the identification of multiple chromosomal segments and candidate genes that may contribute to the disorder's development.",
