  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of scleroderma (also known as progressive systemic sclerosis), a rare autoimmune connective tissue disorder. The content covers the pathophysiology involving abnormal collagen production leading to skin thickening, different types of scleroderma ranging from localized to systemic forms affecting internal organs, epidemiological data showing prevalence of 40,000-165,000 cases in the United States, and demographic patterns including higher incidence in females and typical onset during midlife. The document serves as an educational resource for understanding this complex autoimmune condition.",
