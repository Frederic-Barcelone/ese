  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus-Inversus Syndrome (BPES), detailing the four major characteristic features present at birth: narrowing of eye openings, droopy eyelids, upward fold of inner lower eyelids, and increased distance between eyes. The document distinguishes between BPES type I and type II, with type I additionally associated with premature ovarian insufficiency leading to fertility issues. It also covers minor facial features commonly observed in both types and notes that the syndrome shows no demographic prevalence differences across ethnicity, sex, race, or age.",
