  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the characteristic features and types of BPES, a congenital syndrome affecting eyelid formation and ovarian function.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Blepharophimosis-Ptosis-Epicanthus-Inversus Syndrome (BPES), detailing the four major characteristic features present at birth: blepharophimosis (narrowing of eye opening), ptosis (droopy eyelids), epicanthus inversus (upward fold of inner lower eyelid), and telecanthus (increased distance between eyes). The document distinguishes between BPES type I and type II, with type I additionally associated with premature ovarian insufficiency leading to fertility issues. Additional minor facial features and prevalence information are also covered, making this a valuable reference for understanding this rare congenital syndrome.",
