  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), a rare inherited multisystem disorder belonging to the ectodermal dysplasias group. The document details the primary characteristics of HED including partial or complete absence of eccrine sweat glands leading to anhidrosis or hypohidrosis, heat intolerance, sparse hair (hypotrichosis), and dental abnormalities. It describes characteristic facial features such as prominent forehead, saddle nose, thick lips, and large chin, along with skin manifestations including thinness, dryness, hypopigmentation, and periorbital hyperpigmentation. The document also covers associated complications including respiratory and gastrointestinal mucous gland underdevelopment, immune system dysfunction, and increased susceptibility to infections, asthma, rhinitis, and eczema.",
