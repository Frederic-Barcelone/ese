Cone dystrophy is a general term used to describe a group of rare eye disorders that affect the cone cells of the retina. Cone dystrophy can variably cause a variety of symptoms including decreased visual clarity (acuity) when looking straight ahead (central vision), a reduced ability to see colors and an increased sensitivity to light (photophobia). Cone dystrophy may be broken down into two broad groups - stationary and progressive. In stationary cone dystrophy symptoms tend to remain stable and are usually present at birth or early childhood. In progressive cone dystrophy symptoms slowly become worse over time. There are several different forms of cone dystrophy. The age of onset, progression and severity of cone dystrophy can vary greatly from one person to another, even among individuals with the same type of cone dystrophy. Some forms of cone dystrophy are inherited; other forms appear to occur spontaneously for no apparent reason (sporadically). Cone dystrophy affects males and females in equal numbers when it occurs sporadically or is inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait. The X-linked recessive form of cone dystrophy only affects males fully, although some females may have mild symptoms of the disorder. The exact incidence of cone dystrophy is unknown and estimates tend to vary in the medical literature. Most sources estimate the incidence as approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals in the general population. Cone dystrophy is usually present in early infancy or during childhood or early adulthood. However, the disorder has been reported to develop in individuals of all ages including older adults.
