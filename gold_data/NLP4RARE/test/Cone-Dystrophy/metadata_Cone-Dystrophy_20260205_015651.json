  "short_description": "A comprehensive overview of cone dystrophy, a group of rare eye disorders affecting retinal cone cells that cause vision problems including reduced acuity, color vision defects, and light sensitivity.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a detailed examination of cone dystrophy, encompassing the various forms of this rare retinal disorder that affects cone cells. The document covers the classification of cone dystrophy into stationary and progressive types, describes the range of symptoms including central vision loss, color vision deficiency, and photophobia, and discusses the genetic inheritance patterns including autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, and X-linked forms. It addresses the variable onset, progression, and severity of the condition, noting that symptoms can appear from early infancy through adulthood. The document also provides epidemiological information, estimating the incidence at approximately 1 in 30,000 individuals in the general population.",
