  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Bernard-Soulier syndrome, a rare bleeding disorder affecting platelet function, including symptoms, prevalence, and diagnostic methods.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS), a rare inherited bleeding disorder that affects approximately 1 in a million people worldwide. The document details the characteristic symptoms including excessive bleeding from injuries, nosebleeds, heavy menstrual flow, easy bruising, and purpura or petechiae. It explains that while symptoms typically appear at birth and persist throughout life, some individuals may remain asymptomatic until adulthood. The document outlines the diagnostic approach, which involves blood testing for thrombocytopenia, microscopic examination for abnormally large and irregularly shaped platelets, flow cytometry to measure missing protein expression, and molecular genetic testing to identify specific gene mutations. With over 200 cases reported globally, this document serves as an educational resource for understanding this rare hematological condition that affects males and females equally.",
