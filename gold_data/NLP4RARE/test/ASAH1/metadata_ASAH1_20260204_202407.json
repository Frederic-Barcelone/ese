  "long_description": "This document provides information about ASAH1-related disorders, which are extremely rare genetic conditions caused by acid ceramidase deficiency. These disorders affect males and females equally and have been documented in fewer than 200 individuals in medical literature. The document highlights the challenges in diagnosis and prevalence estimation, as these rare disorders are often undiagnosed or misdiagnosed, making it difficult to determine their true frequency in the general population. ASAH1-related disorders represent a significant diagnostic challenge in clinical practice due to their rarity and potential for misidentification.",
