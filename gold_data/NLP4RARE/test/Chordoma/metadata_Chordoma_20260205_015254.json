  "short_description": "Clinical overview of chordoma, a rare malignant bone tumor, including demographics, incidence rates, and anatomical distribution patterns.",
  "long_description": "This document provides comprehensive epidemiological data on chordoma, a rare malignant bone tumor that primarily affects adults between 40-75 years of age. The text details key demographic patterns including the 2:1 male predominance overall, equal gender distribution for skull base tumors, and higher prevalence of skull base involvement in children. It establishes chordoma's rarity with an incidence of 1 per million people and approximately 300 new US cases annually, representing 1-4% of malignant bone tumors and 20% of primary spinal tumors. The document also includes comparative information about chondrosarcoma, another cartilage-derived bone cancer, highlighting differences in age distribution and anatomical involvement patterns.",
