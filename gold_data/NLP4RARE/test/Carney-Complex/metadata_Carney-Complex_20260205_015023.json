  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Carney complex, a rare disorder affecting approximately 600 reported individuals with equal gender distribution and mean diagnosis age of 20.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides demographic and epidemiological information about Carney complex, a rare genetic disorder first described in medical literature in 1985. The document outlines key characteristics including its equal prevalence between males and females, the relatively small number of documented cases (approximately 600 individuals), and the typical age presentation patterns. While the disorder can manifest at any age, the average age at diagnosis is 20 years, suggesting it often presents during adolescence or early adulthood. This information serves as foundational knowledge for understanding the population affected by this uncommon medical condition.",
