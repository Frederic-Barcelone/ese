  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of functional neurological disorder (FND), a medical condition characterized by disrupted nervous system functioning and impaired brain-body signal transmission without underlying structural pathology. Unlike conditions such as multiple sclerosis or stroke that involve physical damage to neural structures, FND represents a functional impairment in how the nervous system processes and transmits signals. The document explains that FND can manifest through diverse neurological symptoms including limb weakness and seizures, highlighting the broad spectrum of presentations that can occur in this condition.",
