  "short_description": "Clinical overview of liposarcoma covering its unknown etiology, demographic patterns, risk factors, and differential diagnosis from similar soft tissue tumors.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of liposarcoma, a soft tissue sarcoma affecting approximately 2,000 individuals annually in the United States. The document discusses the unknown specific etiology while explaining the role of genetic mutations in fat cells leading to malignant transformation. It details the epidemiological characteristics, noting the predominance in middle-aged men (50-65 years) and rarity in children. The text outlines established risk factors including prior radiation exposure, familial cancer syndromes, lymphatic system damage, and exposure to toxic chemicals like vinyl chloride. Additionally, it addresses the differential diagnosis, distinguishing liposarcoma from benign lipomas and other similar-appearing soft tissue tumors such as undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma and gastrointestinal stromal tumors.",
