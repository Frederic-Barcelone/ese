  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of Stickler syndrome, one of the most common connective tissue disorders in the United States. It discusses the condition's prevalence rates, estimated at 1-3 per 10,000 births, while noting that the disorder is believed to be significantly under-diagnosed. The document outlines the diagnostic process, which relies on thorough clinical evaluation, detailed patient history, and identification of characteristic findings. It acknowledges the current lack of universally agreed-upon diagnostic criteria and describes various testing methods including x-ray studies and eye examinations used to detect and evaluate the severity of associated abnormalities.",
