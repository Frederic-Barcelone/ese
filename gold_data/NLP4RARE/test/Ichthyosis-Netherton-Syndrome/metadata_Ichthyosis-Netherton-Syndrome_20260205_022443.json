  "long_description": "This document provides a clinical overview of Netherton syndrome, a rare hereditary disorder inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. The syndrome is characterized by distinctive features including scaling skin (ichthyosis), hair anomalies, increased susceptibility to atopic eczema, and elevated IgE levels. With approximately 150 cases reported in medical literature, the condition is considered extremely rare, though the actual prevalence may be higher due to diagnostic challenges and symptom overlap with more common conditions such as atopic dermatitis and other congenital ichthyoses. The document serves as a reference for understanding this complex dermatological condition and its clinical presentation.",
