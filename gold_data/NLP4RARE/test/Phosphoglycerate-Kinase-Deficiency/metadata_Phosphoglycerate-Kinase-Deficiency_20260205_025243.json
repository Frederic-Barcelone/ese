  "short_description": "Clinical document describing phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) deficiency, a rare X-linked disorder affecting males with potential carrier symptoms in females.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides an overview of phosphoglycerate kinase deficiency, a very rare genetic disorder that primarily affects males due to its X-linked inheritance pattern. The document discusses how heterozygous female carriers may experience symptoms such as hemolytic anemia, diagnostic approaches including enzymatic testing available at birth, and the clinical presentation of the disorder. With more than 30 documented cases in medical literature, the document emphasizes that many cases likely remain undiagnosed and outlines the diagnostic process involving thorough physical examination and confirmatory laboratory testing.",
