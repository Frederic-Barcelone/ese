  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of holoprosencephaly (HPE), a serious congenital brain malformation that occurs when the prosencephalon (forebrain) fails to develop normally during fetal development. The document explains the pathophysiology of the condition, detailing how abnormal continuity between brain hemispheres replaces normal complete separation. It categorizes the three main types of HPE based on severity: alobar (complete lack of separation), semilobar (partial separation), and lobar (mostly separated with incomplete division). The document also presents epidemiological data, noting equal gender distribution, occurrence across ethnic groups, and incidence rates of 1 in 250 during early embryonic development and 1 in 16,000 live births.",
