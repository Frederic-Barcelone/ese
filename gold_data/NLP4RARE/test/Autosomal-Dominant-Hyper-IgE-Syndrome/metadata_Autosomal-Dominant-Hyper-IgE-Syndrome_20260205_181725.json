  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of autosomal dominant hyper-IgE syndrome (AD-HIES), a rare multisystem primary immunodeficiency disorder that typically manifests in infancy or childhood. The condition is characterized by recurrent bacterial infections of the skin and lungs, skeletal abnormalities, and characteristic facial features, with eczema often being the first presenting symptom. The document explains that mutations in the STAT3 gene are responsible for over 60% of AD-HIES cases, with most occurring as de novo mutations. It also distinguishes between the autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive forms of hyper-IgE syndrome, noting that while both involve immune system defects and elevated immunoglobulin E levels, they are now considered distinct disorders rather than different expressions of the same condition.",
