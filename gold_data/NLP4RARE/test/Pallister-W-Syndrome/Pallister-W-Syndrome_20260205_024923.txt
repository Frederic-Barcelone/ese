Pallister W syndrome is a rare genetic disorder characterized by unusual facial features such as clefting of the palate and the upper lip, a broad flat nose, widely spaced slanted eyes, and/or downslanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures). Other symptoms may include mental retardation, speech problems, bone deformities of the arms and legs, and/or seizures. The exact cause of Pallister W syndrome is not known. Pallister W syndrome is apparent at birth. It is characterized by widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism) with downward slanting eyelid folds (palpebral fissures), a broad flat nasal bridge, a broad tip of the nose, a broad flat jaw, central clefting of the palate or upper lip, seizures, and mental retardation. There may also be bone abnormalities in the arms and legs such as abnormal deviation of the elbow away from the body when the arm is extended (cubitus valgus). Other symptoms may include hair that does not lie flat on the head (cowlick), missing teeth (partial adontia), broad uvula, and a high broad forehead. Additional findings may include tremor and/or involuntary muscle contractions (i.e., spasticity). Pallister W syndrome is a very rare disorder. As of the year 2000, only six cases had been reported in the medical literature. More than half involved male infants but the numbers are not large enough to draw any conclusions regarding whether it affects one sex more than the other. The characteristic facial features assist in the diagnosis.
