  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Medullary Sponge Kidney, a rare renal disorder affecting the collecting ducts and tubular structures of one or both kidneys. The document covers the clinical presentation including hematuria, nephrolithiasis, and infections, discusses the unknown etiology with possible genetic and hormonal factors, and presents epidemiological data showing prevalence of 1 in 1,000 to 5,000 people with slight female predominance. It also addresses the typical age of symptom onset during adolescence or ages 30-50, the association with kidney stone formation in 13% of cases, and potential connections to Beckwith-Wiedemann Syndrome and hyperparathyroidism.",
