  "short_description": "Clinical overview of pachydermoperiostosis, a rare disorder characterized by finger clubbing, facial skin thickening, and excessive sweating that primarily affects males.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical description of pachydermoperiostosis, a rare medical condition that represents the complete form of hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (HOA). The disorder is characterized by three main features: digital clubbing of the fingers, pachyderma (thickening of facial skin), and hyperhidrosis (excessive sweating). The condition typically manifests during childhood or adolescence, particularly around puberty, and progresses slowly over approximately ten years. The document details the significant male predominance (7:1 ratio) and explains that females may present with milder symptoms, making diagnosis more challenging. It outlines the clinical diagnostic criteria and describes both complete and incomplete forms of the condition, including variants with clubbing alone, periostosis without clubbing, and isolated pachyderma.",
