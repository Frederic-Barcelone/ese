Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder characterized by clubbing of the fingers, thickening of the skin of the face (pachyderma), and excessive sweating (hyperhidrosis). It typically appears during childhood or adolescence, often around the time of puberty, and progresses slowly for about ten years. Pachydermoperiostosis is a rare disorder that affects males more often than females with a ratio of 7:1. This ratio may not be totally valid since females often have milder symptoms than do men, with the fibrous bone growth (periostosis) not being detected unless X-rays are taken. Diagnosis is made clinically. Major diagnostic criteria for HOA are clubbing of the fingers (digital clubbing) and fibrous bone growth (periostosis). Pachydermoperiostosis is the complete form of HOA. There are also three incomplete forms. clubbing alone, periostosis without clubbing, and pachyderma.
