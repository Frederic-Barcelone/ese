Fournier gangrene is an acute necrotic infection of the scrotum; penis; or perineum. It is characterized by scrotum pain and redness with rapid progression to gangrene and sloughing of tissue. Fournier gangrene is usually secondary to perirectal or periurethral infections associated with local trauma, operative procedures, or urinary tract disease. The mean age of presentation is about 50 years, but the range of patient ages in reported cases is from eight days to 90 years. Fournier gangrene is diagnosed more frequently among males. It may be that the high male to female ratio in the diagnosis is the result of the lack of recognition of this entity among women by physicians. It is believed that the male to female proportion may be anywhere from 5:1 to 10:1.
