  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Fournier gangrene, an acute necrotic infection affecting the genital and perineal regions with rapid progression to tissue death.",
  "long_description": "This clinical reference document provides a comprehensive overview of Fournier gangrene, a serious acute necrotic infection that affects the scrotum, penis, or perineum. The document details the characteristic presentation including scrotal pain and redness that rapidly progresses to gangrene and tissue sloughing. It explains the typical etiology as secondary infections from perirectal or periurethral sources, often associated with local trauma, surgical procedures, or urinary tract disease. The document also presents important epidemiological data, noting that while the condition has a wide age range (8 days to 90 years), the mean presentation age is approximately 50 years, with a significant male predominance that may be influenced by underrecognition in female patients.",
