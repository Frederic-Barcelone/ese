  "short_description": "Clinical document describing the epidemiology, demographics, and diagnostic approach for Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), particularly in pediatric populations.",
  "long_description": "This clinical research document provides a comprehensive overview of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), focusing on its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic methodology. The document details that while ADEM can occur at any age, it predominantly affects children with a mean presentation age of 5-8 years and shows seasonal patterns peaking in winter and spring months. It discusses the estimated incidence rate of 0.4 per 100,000 in individuals under 20 years of age based on San Diego population studies. The document emphasizes the diagnostic approach, which relies on identifying characteristic symptoms, obtaining detailed patient history, conducting thorough clinical evaluations, and utilizing specialized testing including MRI imaging to demonstrate characteristic brain lesions. Additional differential diagnostic testing including infectious, immunologic, and metabolic assessments are also outlined as part of the comprehensive diagnostic workup.",
