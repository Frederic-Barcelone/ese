A diagnosis of ADEM is made based upon identification of characteristic symptoms, a detailed patient history, a thorough clinical evaluation and a variety of specialized tests including imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). An MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce cross-sectional images of particular organs and bodily tissues and can demonstrate characteristic brain lesions in individuals with ADEM. Additional tests to exclude other conditions may also be performed. Such tests may include infectious,",
