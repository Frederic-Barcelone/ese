  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM), focusing on its epidemiological characteristics and diagnostic methodology. The document details that ADEM predominantly affects children with a mean presentation age of 5-8 years, shows equal gender distribution with slight male preponderance in some pediatric studies, and has an estimated incidence of 0.4 per 100,000 in persons under 20 years. It describes seasonal patterns with peak occurrence in winter and spring months, and outlines the diagnostic approach which relies on characteristic symptoms, patient history, clinical evaluation, and specialized testing including MRI imaging to identify characteristic brain lesions. The document also mentions the importance of additional tests to exclude other conditions.",
