  "short_description": "Clinical overview of Kniest dysplasia, a rare form of dwarfism caused by COL2A1 gene mutations affecting type 2 collagen production.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of Kniest dysplasia, a rare genetic skeletal disorder classified as one of several forms of dwarfism. The condition results from mutations in the COL2A1 gene, which is responsible for producing proteins essential for type 2 collagen formation. This collagen is crucial for normal bone and connective tissue development. The document explains how alterations in type 2 collagen composition lead to abnormal skeletal growth, resulting in various dwarfing conditions known as skeletal dysplasias. It covers the epidemiology, noting equal prevalence in males and females, clinical presentation in newborns showing distress, and diagnostic approaches including radiographic examination and bone biopsy for confirmation in ambiguous cases.",
