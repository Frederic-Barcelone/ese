  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of filariasis, an infectious tropical disease caused by thread-like parasitic roundworms, primarily Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi. The text covers the disease transmission mechanism through mosquito bites, clinical presentation including early symptoms (fever, chills, headaches, skin lesions) and chronic complications (lymphatic obstruction leading to severe swelling of extremities and genitals). It discusses the global epidemiology, noting the disease's prevalence in tropical regions of Africa, Asia, China, and South America, while being extremely rare in North America. The document also addresses risk factors for travelers and immigrants, treatment approaches using antiparasitic agents, and the pathophysiology involving inflammatory responses to adult worms and potential hypersensitivity reactions to microfilariae.",
