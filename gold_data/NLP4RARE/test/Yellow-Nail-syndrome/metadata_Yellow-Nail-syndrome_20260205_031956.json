  "short_description": "Clinical document describing yellow nail syndrome, a rare disorder characterized by nail malformations, respiratory abnormalities, and lymphedema.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of yellow nail syndrome, an extremely rare disorder that primarily affects older adults. The document details the characteristic triad of symptoms including distinctive nail malformations affecting both fingernails and toenails, respiratory tract abnormalities, and lymphedema causing swelling in various body parts due to protein-rich fluid accumulation. The text discusses the unknown etiology of the condition while noting potential genetic factors in familial cases, and emphasizes the importance of clinical evaluation and patient history in diagnosis. The document also distinguishes the unique nail changes in yellow nail syndrome from those seen in other lymphedema syndromes.",
