  "short_description": "Clinical documentation of a rare chromosomal disorder involving deletion of the short arm of chromosome 7, characterized by craniosynostosis and craniofacial abnormalities.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Chromosome 7, Partial Monosomy 7p, a rare genetic disorder caused by deletion of a portion of the short arm (p) of chromosome 7. The document details the variable clinical presentation depending on the size and location of the deleted segment, with primary features including premature closure of cranial sutures (craniosynostosis) leading to abnormal head shapes such as trigonocephaly or turricephaly. Additional craniofacial malformations may include microcephaly, abnormal eye spacing, and distinctive eyelid features. The document notes that this condition affects both sexes equally, with over 30 cases reported in medical literature, and emphasizes the importance of chromosomal testing for accurate diagnosis and differentiation from similar chromosomal disorders.",
