  "short_description": "Clinical overview of myofibrillar myopathies, a group of rare genetic neuromuscular disorders characterized by progressive muscle weakness affecting skeletal and cardiac muscle.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of myofibrillar myopathies, a group of rare genetic neuromuscular disorders that typically manifest after age 40, though childhood onset is possible. The text describes the characteristic features including slowly progressive weakness affecting both proximal and distal skeletal muscles, as well as smooth muscle involvement. Cardiac complications are highlighted as common manifestations, including cardiomyopathy presenting as arrhythmias, conduction defects, or congestive heart failure. The document addresses the diagnostic challenges, noting that these conditions are likely underrecognized and underdiagnosed. It outlines the diagnostic approach involving clinical assessment, electromyography, nerve conduction studies, and muscle biopsy, along with available molecular genetic testing options for multiple genes including DES, CRYAB, MYOT, LDB3, ZASP, and BAG3.",
