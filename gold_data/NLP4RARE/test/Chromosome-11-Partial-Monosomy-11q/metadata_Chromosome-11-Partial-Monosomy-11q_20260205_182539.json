  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of partial monosomy 11q, commonly referred to as Jacobsen syndrome. It details this rare chromosomal disorder characterized by deletion of genetic material from chromosome 11, affecting approximately 1 in 100,000 births. The document covers the variable range and severity of symptoms depending on the location and size of the chromosomal deletion, including growth retardation, developmental delays, intellectual disability, and characteristic physical abnormalities. It discusses craniofacial dimorphism, limb abnormalities, congenital ear defects, bleeding disorders due to platelet abnormalities, and immunological defects. The document also provides epidemiological information, noting that the condition was first described in 1973, with over 200 cases documented in medical literature, and appears to affect more females than males.",
