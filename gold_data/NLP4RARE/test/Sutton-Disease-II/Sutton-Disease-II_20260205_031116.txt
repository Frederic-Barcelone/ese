Sutton disease II is characterized by the recurring eruption of painful inflamed ulcers in the mouth (stomatitis). There may be multiple ulcers of varying sizes. These ulcers in the mouth are commonly called canker sores. Sutton disease II is also known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis. The exact cause of this disease is not fully understood, although it may be due to an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally in the mouth. The exact cause of Sutton disease II is not known. Several studies suggest that it may occur because of an abnormal immune response to the bacteria that are normally present in the mouth. Deficiencies of iron, vitamin B12, and folic acid seem to increase an individual’s susceptibility to this disease. Stress and local injury may also be involved. There seems to be no relationship between Sutton disease II and menstruation, pregnancy, and/or menopause, nor is it caused by herpes virus, which is the main cause of common canker sores. Sutton disease Il affects more adult females than males. However, before puberty, males and females are equally affected. This disease occurs most frequently in malnourished children or adults whose immune systems are suppressed (i.e., by chemotherapy) or compromised (i.e., acquired immune deficiency syndrome).
