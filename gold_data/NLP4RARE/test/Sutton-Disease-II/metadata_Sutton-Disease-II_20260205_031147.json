  "short_description": "Clinical document describing Sutton disease II, a condition characterized by recurring painful mouth ulcers (canker sores) with unknown exact etiology.",
  "long_description": "This clinical document provides a comprehensive overview of Sutton disease II, also known as recurrent aphthous stomatitis, which manifests as recurring episodes of painful, inflamed ulcers in the mouth. The document discusses the unclear etiology of the condition, suggesting potential involvement of abnormal immune responses to normal oral bacteria, nutritional deficiencies (iron, vitamin B12, folic acid), stress, and local injury. It clarifies that the condition is not related to herpes virus or hormonal changes, and notes demographic patterns showing higher prevalence in adult females and increased occurrence in malnourished individuals or those with compromised immune systems.",
