  "short_description": "Clinical overview of osteosarcoma, the most common bone cancer affecting children and adolescents, covering symptoms, demographics, and treatment approaches.",
  "long_description": "This document provides a comprehensive clinical overview of osteosarcoma, a primary bone cancer that predominantly affects children and adolescents during their teenage years. The text covers key epidemiological data, including the annual incidence of 750-1,000 new cases in the United States with 450 cases occurring in patients under 20 years old. It details the typical presentation patterns, with 80% of cases presenting as localized disease, common anatomical locations (long bones near knees and shoulders), and primary symptoms including pain and palpable masses. The document discusses demographic patterns showing slight male predominance and higher incidence in African-American and Hispanic/Latino populations, treatment modalities combining chemotherapy and surgery, and the potential for metastasis primarily to the lungs.",
