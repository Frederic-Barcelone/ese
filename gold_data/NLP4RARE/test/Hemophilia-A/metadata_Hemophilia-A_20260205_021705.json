  "long_description": "This clinical reference document presents key epidemiological and demographic information about Hemophilia A, the most common X-linked recessive disorder and second most prevalent inherited clotting factor deficiency. The document outlines the disorder's prevalence (1 in 5,000 males), severity distribution (60% severe cases), gender predisposition (primarily males with possible female involvement), and equal distribution across all racial and ethnic populations. This information serves as foundational knowledge for healthcare professionals involved in the diagnosis, management, and genetic counseling of patients with inherited bleeding disorders.",
