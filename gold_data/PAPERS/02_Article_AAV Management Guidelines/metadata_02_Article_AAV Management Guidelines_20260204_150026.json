  "long_description": "This document presents the 2022 update to the EULAR (European League Against Rheumatism) recommendations for managing ANCA-associated vasculitis (AAV), building upon the previous 2016 guidelines. The update incorporates findings from recent landmark clinical trials examining plasma exchange, standardized glucocorticoid dosing, rituximab for maintenance therapy, and novel treatments including C5a receptor-targeted therapy and anti-interleukin 5 therapy for eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (EGPA). Developed by a task force of 20 experts from 16 countries using systematic literature review and EULAR standardized procedures, the guidelines provide 4 overarching principles and 17 specific recommendations covering diagnosis, remission induction, maintenance therapy, and treatment of refractory disease. The recommendations emphasize evidence-based approaches while acknowledging remaining data gaps that require informed physician-patient decision-making.",
