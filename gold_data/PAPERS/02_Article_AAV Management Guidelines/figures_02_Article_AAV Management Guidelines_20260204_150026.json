      "description": "This is a line graph comparing prednisolone/prednisone doses over 26 weeks post-diagnosis between standard AAV induction trial protocols (black line) and the reduced glucocorticoid group from the PEXIVAS trial (red line). Both protocols show a steep decline in dosing from week 1 to week 8, with the PEXIVAS reduced group maintaining consistently lower doses throughout the treatment period. The graph demonstrates that the reduced glucocorticoid protocol achieves significantly lower steroid exposure while following a similar tapering pattern to standard protocols.",
