2. INTRODUCTION
2.1. Study Rationale
Motor nerves ending at the NMJ release acetylcholine to activate postsynaptic AChRs present on the surface of muscle fibers and induce voluntary muscle contractions. Autoantibodies against the AChR play an essential role in the pathophysiology of MG and may interfere with receptor function or prompt receptor internalization and degradation. Most importantly, though, anti-AChR autoantibodies cause NMJ degeneration through activation of the complement system.
Anti-AChR autoantibodies are immunoglobulins of the G1 and G3 subtypes which attract complement component Clq. Deposition of Clq triggers the classical complement pathway leading to the cleavage of C5 into C5a and C5b. C5b initiates the assembly of the MACs and destruction of the motor end plate (Dalakas, 2020; Gavriilaki, 2020), reducing the efficiency and reliability of neuromuscular signalling.
Evidence of complement activity in anti-AChR antibody-positive gMG is provided by histopathological findings of complement deposition and MAC formation at motor end plates, studies demonstrating interference of AChR autoantibodies with functional domains of the AChR (Li, 2025) and NMJ destruction in the presence of MACs (Engel, 1977), experimental models of autoimmune myasthenia gravis (EAMG) (Tiiziin, 2013), and the established clinical benefits achieved by terminal complement inhibition.
Blocking terminal complement activity is now an established effective therapeutic approach to gMG that has been endorsed by neuromuscular disease experts in treatment guidelines (Narayanaswami, 2021; Sanders, 2016).
The PREVAIL Phase 3 gefurulimab study in gMG showed that gefurulimab met the primary and all secondary endpoints, with participants achieving complete terminal complement inhibition, defined as serum free C5 < 0.5 t1g/mL over the treatment period in patients with gMG. Approximately half of incident MG cases present with muscle weakness restricted to ocular muscles known as oMG or Myasthenia Gravis Foundation of America (MGFA) Class | (Garcia Estévez, 2020; Hendricks, 2019; Mercelis, 2023; Santos, 2016). MGFA Classes II — IV extend the disease continuum and represent gMG of increasing severity. However, the disease mechanism for oMG is similar to gMG.
Ocular muscle fibers are more susceptible to AChR receptor loss for a variety of reasons including higher frequency of synaptic firing in twitch fibers of EOMs compared to limb muscles, making them more susceptible to fatigue; fewer AChRs on tonic muscles necessary for sustained gaze, making them more susceptible to receptor loss or damage and reduced expression of complement regulatory proteins on ocular muscle fibers (Bril, 2024; Soltys, 2008). A proportion of oMG patients do not achieve adequate control with current SoC treatment (Behbehani, 2023; Kerty, 2014), resulting in chronic and fluctuating diplopia and ptosis. Effective management of oMG requires continuous control of the mechanisms responsible for the disease’s pathophysiology. Achievement and maintenance of a status at which clinical signs and symptoms of the underlying condition are absent or minimally present is widely accepted as the treatment goal for various chronic disabling immuno-mediated diseases (eg, bronchial asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis, and rheumatoid arthritis).

Compared with conventional antibodies, gefurulimab has a low molecular weight, allowing it to be concentrated in small volumes suitable for home SC injection convenient for the oMG patients. Another benefit of gefurulimab is its long elimination half-life, allowing convenient QIW dosing intervals. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of gefurulimab for the treatment of oMG in adults > 18 years of age with autoantibodies against AChR (AChR+). The study will also evaluate the safety and performance of the administration device (PFS-SD).
Current therapies for MG aim to improve neuromuscular transmission at the NMJ (symptomatic treatment) or target immunological mechanisms underlying the disease pathophysiology. For patients with MGFA Class 1, or oMG, the standard of care has been unchanged for decades and includes symptomatic treatment with AChE inhibitors, disease-modifying treatment with steroids, steroid-sparing immunosuppressants. None of the standard chronic or maintenance treatment options specifically address the autoimmune defect in MG or the underlying pathophysiology or mechanism of NMJ injury due to anti-AChR antibody-AChR interactions, complement activation, and the resultant NMJ destruction. Gefurulimab was developed for the treatment of gMG with these needs in mind and is now being evaluated for oMG.

4. STUDY DESIGN
4.1. Overall Design
ALXN1720-oMG-303 is a Phase 3, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled, multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy, safety, PK, PD, and immunogenicity of gefurulimab in participants > 18 years of age (at screening) with oMG.
Approximately 168 eligible participants will be stratified by geographical region (eg, North America, Europe), steroid use at baseline (Yes or No) and baseline MGII ocular (PRO) score category (6 to 10, or 11 to 18) and randomized 1:1 to treatment with gefurulimab or placebo. Both active treatment and placebo will be administered through SC injections by using a PFS-SD.
A non-binding interim analysis for efficacy and futility will be performed when approximately 96 participants have completed Week 12 of the RCT Period. The futility will be assessed using the predictive probability of final study success.
The study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (< 4 weeks), RCT (12 weeks), and OLE (52 weeks) (Figure 1). Consenting participants will be screened for study eligibility up to 4 weeks prior to Day 1. Participants with confirmed oMG (MGFA Class I) (Jaretzki, 2000) and a positive serological test for AChR autoantibodies at Screening will be included if their MGII (PRO) ocular score is > 6 and at least 2 ocular items with a score of > 2. Participants with any gMG symptoms anytime during the disease course comprising MGFA Classes II and above will be excluded from the study.
Participants who satisfy all eligibility criteria will be randomized into the RCT Period and receive a 600 mg loading dose of gefurulimab (or placebo) on Day 1, followed by 300 mg once weekly maintenance treatment with gefurulimab (or placebo), starting one week (Day 8) and after the initial dose for a total of 12 weeks. During their first 5 visits, participants and, if applicable, their caregivers will be trained in administering the study intervention by designated study site personnel. Once training is complete and certified, participants may self-administer the treatment at home unless the scheduled dose falls on the same day as an upcoming Clinic Visit. In this case, participants will be asked to administer the study intervention at the clinic under supervision of the study site personnel to monitor their injection skills.
Participants who complete the 12-week RCT Period will continue the study through the 52-week OLE Period. Participants will transition to open-label treatment with gefurulimab following completion of the Day 85 (Week 12) assessments. To maintain the masking of participants for their treatment allocation in the previous RCT Period, the first dose upon entry to the OLE Period on Day 85 (Week 12) will be administered by study site personnel. Participants who were in the placebo group during the RCT Period will receive a masked loading dose of gefurulimab. Participants who were in the gefurulimab group during the RCT Period will receive a masked maintenance dose and one additional injection of placebo to match the number of injections required for a loading dose. Participants will resume the weekly open-label self-administered maintenance doses the following week (Day 64; Week 9).
The maximum overall study duration for active participants will be approximately 56 weeks (from Screening through OLE). A SFU Visit will be conducted 12 weeks (~ 5 mean elimination half-lives) after the last dose of the study intervention. SFU will not be required if the

Investigator determines that a participant is benefitting from treatment with gefurulimab in the OLE, and the participant continues treatment because they can be provided with gefurulimab through appropriate mechanism, for example a post-trial access program as allowed by local laws and regulations.
If a participant discontinues treatment or withdraws from the study early or completes the study prior to the end of the OLE Period, the participant will be encouraged to return for an ET/EOS Visit as soon as possible.
Figure 1: Study Design Schematic
* An interim analysis for early efficacy and futility will be performed after approximately 96 participants have completed Week 12 of the RCT Period.
4.2. Scientific Rationale for Study Design
The goal of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of gefurulimab compared with placebo in the treatment of adults with oMG based on the ability of participants to perform activities of daily living, and improvement in participants’ symptoms of ptosis and/or diplopia due to improved EOM strength. Primary and key secondary objectives reflect this goal:
e The MGII is a patient centered composite score measuring MG impairment and severity and is responsive to change in status. The ocular subscore (8 items, ranging from 0-23) consists of 6 PRO items with a maximum score of 18 and 2 physical exam items with a maximum score of 5. MGII PRO ocular score as primary endpoint and and PRO + E ocular score as secondary endpoint will be used to assess the impact of oMG and measure treatment-associated changes in disease severity.
e MG-ADL profile is a valid and sensitive instrument to assess impact of MG and measure treatment-associated change in disease severity. A decrease in the MG-ADL total score by 2 points compared to Baseline is considered an indicator of clinical improvement (Muppidi, 2012). Although there isn’t a separate score defined just for ocular symptoms, an improvement in diplopia and ptosis will contribute to an overall improvement in the total scores. MG-ADL will be assessed and ocular subcomponent will be used for oMG.
The study will examine other measures of treatment efficacy and assess the safety and tolerability of the study intervention, the PK, PD, and immunogenicity of gefurulimab, as well as biomarkers that are relevant to the mechanism of action of gefurulimab.

The length of the RCT Period and selection of primary and secondary endpoints at Week 12 are designed to demonstrate sustained changes in ocular symptoms and signs, which is critical in a chronic disease such as oMG. The length of OLE Period will further support the sustained improvement in ocular signs and symptoms.
Eligibility criteria and outcome measures have been chosen based on a review of comparable clinical studies, recommendations provided by the Task Force on MG Study Design of the Medical Scientific Advisory Board of the MGFA (Benatar, 2012), and advice from experts in the field of oMG research.
The study will include adults with oMG corresponding to MGFA Classification Class I to evaluate the therapeutic potential of gefurulimab in participants with moderate or severe ocular muscle weakness. If successful, gefurulimab will provide these participants with a treatment option that they can administer themselves, at home, at convenient weekly dosing intervals.
A fixed dose regimen is being proposed based on modeling and dosing simulations using clinical PK, PD and ADA data from a first-in-human Phase | study of gefurulimab (Study ALXN1720-HV-101), TBD and subject to change based on PREVAIL study data.
4.3. Justification for Dose
The dosage regimen for gefurulimab in this Phase 3 study leverages prior experience in treating complement-mediated diseases (including gMG) with the C5 inhibitors eculizumab, ravulizumab, and gefurulimab. Using gefurulimab PK/PD data from healthy participants (Studies ALXN1720-HV-101, HV-103, and HV-104) and from patients with gMG (ALXN1720-MG- 301), a population PK/PD model was developed and used to identify a gefurulimab dosing regimen predicted to achieve rapid and complete terminal complement inhibition. The proposed gefurulimab dosing regimen in patients with oMG is a fixed dose regimen consisting of a SC loading dose (600 mg) followed by once weekly SC maintenance doses of 300 mg, starting one week after the loading dose. This is consistent with the proposed gefurulimab dose regimen in patients with gMG.
Targeting sustained terminal complement inhibition in patients with gMG has shown favorable benefit/risk profiles following therapeutic dosing with eculizumab and ravulizumab. Based on the totality of PK, PD, ADA, safety, and efficacy data obtained during the development of eculizumab and ravulizumab, and recent experience with gefurulimab treatment in patients with gMG, where achieving complete terminal complement inhibition resulted in a positive benefit/risk profile in patients with gMG, the proposed gefurulimab dosage regimen is expected to be beneficial in treating participants with oMG.
Delayed doses, defined as doses administered > 1 day later than scheduled, should be administered as soon as possible and not later than the next scheduled dose. Replacement of missed doses will be determined on an individual basis.
A supplemental dose of 300 mg of TRADENAME should be administered after every other PE or PP session (within 4 hours, if possible). If PE or PP occurs on a regularly scheduled dosing day, the maintenance dose (and the supplemental dose, if applicable) must be administered after completion of the PE or PP session (within 4 hours, if possible).

Protocol Concept Sheet ALXN1720-oMG-303/D6783C00001
If the supplemental dose cannot be administered as directed, a supplemental dose of 300 mg of TRADENAME should be administered with the next weekly maintenance dose of TRADENAME.
PP/PE rescue therapy is not anticipated to be needed in the oMG indication. However, should PP/PE be required, supplemental dosing is recommended A supplemental dose of 300 mg of gefurulimab should be administered after every other PP or PE session within 4 hours, if possible. If PP or PE occurs on a regularly scheduled dosing day, the maintenance dose (and the supplemental dose, if applicable) must be administer after completion of the PP or PE session. If the 300 mg supplemental dose cannot be administered as directed, it should be administered with the next weekly maintenance dose.
To maintain the masking of treatment allocation in the RCT Period, participants who were in the placebo group during the RCT Period will receive a masked loading dose of gefurulimab at the start of the OLE Period on Day 85 (Week 12). Participants who were in the gefurulimab group during the RCT Period will receive a masked maintenance dose and one additional injection of placebo to match the number of injections required for a loading dose. Weekly open-label maintenance doses will resume the following week (Day 92; Week 13).
Safety and tolerability of gefurulimab have been established over a wide range of PK exposures, including those expected under the proposed oMG dosage regimens, in healthy volunteers and in patients with gMG.
4.4. Duration of Treatment and End-of-Study Definition

6.3. Masking
PFS-SDs containing gefurulimab or placebo will be provided in identical study intervention kits and with identical labels for all participants in the RCT Period. Yellow transparent tape will cover the PFS-SDs to conceal the color difference between gefurulimab and placebo. Because the viscosity of gefurulimab also differs from the placebo formulation, a moderately different injection force will be required for its administration. To maintain the mask despite this difference in viscosity, study sites will be required to designate an independent staff member who can:
e Administer the study intervention during the initial Clinic Visits and Day 85
e Train and supervise participants and, if applicable, their caregivers, for doses that are self-administered
These designated staff members can be a nurse, study coordinator, or Sub-Investigator trained to administer the study intervention. They will remain masked to the participant’s assigned study intervention and are not permitted to communicate observations related to the injection force required to administer the intervention to the study participant, a caregiver, other site personnel, Alexion staff or designees, or any other personnel associated with the conduct of the study. They must not have any other role in the study and, specifically, are not permitted to participate in any other study activities including safety or efficacy assessments.
Once screening for the entire study is complete and all participants at a study site have received their last masked dose at the beginning of the OLE period in Week 12 (Day 85), that study site no longer has to retain a designated staff member for injection training or oversight. Staff members who held that role until Week 12 (Day 85) may now participate in other study activities including safety and efficacy assessments.
Investigators will receive only masked information unless unmasked information is judged necessary for safety reasons. In case of an emergency, the Investigator has the sole responsibility for determining if unmasking of a participants’ intervention assignment is warranted. Participant safety must always be the first consideration in making such a determination. If the Investigator decides that unmasking is warranted, the Investigator may, at the Investigator’s discretion, contact Alexion to discuss the situation prior to unmasking a participant’s intervention assignment unless this could delay emergency treatment for the participant. If unmasking is deemed necessary, the Investigator will be able to unmask the participant’s intervention assignment using the IRT. Ifa participant’s intervention assignment is unmasked, Alexion must be notified within 24 hours after breaking the masking.
In the event of a SUSAR reporting guidance in protocol must be followed. The mask will be maintained for persons responsible for the ongoing conduct of the study (eg, Monitors, Investigators) and those responsible for data analysis and interpretation of results.
To manage the uncertainty associated with the assumed treatment effect for the primary endpoint, an interim analysis for sample size re-estimation will be performed after approximately 56 participants have completed Week 12 of the RCT Period. The analysis will be reviewed by an independent DMC. The sample size may be increased to a maximum of 186 participants if the conditional power based on the estimated treatment effect in the primary endpoint falls within

the promising zone of 41% to 90%. Additional details of the interim analysis will be provided in the SAP.
Except for these emergency situations, unmasked information will only be accessible to those who are involved in safety reporting to Health Authorities, IECs, and/or IRBs.
7. STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS
Statistical methods for this study will be further detailed in a separate SAP. Statistical analyses will include tabulations of summary data, inferential analyses, by patient listings and figures. Inference from efficacy analyses will be based on a 2-sided type I error rate (a) of 5% (one-sided type I error rate of 2.5%) unless stated otherwise. The summary statistics for continuous variables will include, but not be limited to, the number of patients, mean, standard deviation, minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages will be presented.
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) will be the primary population used for the analysis of all efficacy endpoints for the RCT Period. Supplemental per protocol analyses for primary and secondary efficacy endpoints will be performed based on the Per Protocol Set (PPS) in the same manner as done for the FAS. Safety analyses will be performed on the Safety Set (SS).
The baseline value for analysis and reporting will be based on the last non missing measurement prior to the first dose of study intervention unless stated otherwise.
Analyses will be performed using the SAS software Version 9.4 or higher.
7.1. Sample Size Determination
The sample size determination of N = 168 was based on the following assumptions:
e The MMRM method is used to compare gefurulimab and placebo in the change from Baseline of MGII (PRO) ocular score at Week 12;
e 1:1 gefurulimab and placebo randomization;
e At least 160 participant complete RCT period; (approximately 5% dropout rate);
e The treatment difference (gefurulimab - placebo) is assumed to be -2.7 based on available data on MGII (PRO) ocular score from (Barnett, 2017);
e Common SD is conservatively assumed to be 5.2 based on available data from (Barnett, Bril, Kapral, Kulkarni and Davis, 2017);
e 2-sided significance level of 0.05 (one-sided 0.025)
With these assumptions, simulation demonstrates that a sample size of 160 participants (168 participants if including dropout) provides an overall power of 90.2% to detect a treatment difference in change from baseline of MGII ocular (PRO) with significance level of 0.00381 at interim and 0.02380 at the final analysis.

7.2. Analysis Sets
The population sets used for analysis are defined in Table 3.
Table 3 Analysis Sets
Analysis Set Description Randomized Set All randomized participants grouped by randomized treatment group. Full Analysis Set (FAS) All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of study ntervention. Participants will be analyzed as randomized. Per-Protocol Set (PPS) All FAS participants without important protocol deviations that are likely to impact efficacy during the RCT Period. The PPS will be fully defined in the SAP prior to database lock. Participants will be analyzed as randomized. PK Analysis Set (PKAS) All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of study intervention and have at least 1 evaluable postbaseline PK concentration. PD Analysis Set (PDAS) All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of study ntervention and have at least 1 evaluable postbaseline PD data point. Safety Set (SS) All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose of study ntervention. Participants will be analyzed according to the study ntervention they received. Immunogenicity Analysis All randomized participants who receive at least 1 dose (full or partial) Set (IAS) of study intervention and have at least 1 reportable postdose result in the ADA assay. Participants will be analyzed according to the study ntervention they received. OLE Set All randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of gefurulimab in the OLE period. Gefurulimab Treated Set All participants who receive at least 1 dose of gefurulimab either in the RCT or the OLE Period.
7.3. Statistical Analyses
7.3.1. Primary Endpoint Analysis
The primary endpoint, change from baseline in the MGII (PRO) ocular score at Week 12, will be analyzed using MMRM methodology with all available data during RCT period. All intercurrent events other than death will be handled using treatment policy strategy. For death, a while on treatment strategy will be applied. Missing data will not be imputed for the primary analysis. The model will include change in MGII (PRO) ocular score from Baseline at each prespecified time point as the response variable, fixed categorical effects of treatment, study visit and treatment-by-study visit interaction, geographical region, steroid use at baseline and baseline MGII (PRO) ocular score. The treatment effect will be evaluated via contrast for the treatment-by-visit term at Week 12. An unstructured covariance matrix will be used to model the correlations among

repeated measurements within each participant. Other covariance structures will be implemented if a convergence issue occurs (details to be provided in the SAP). The Kenward-Roger method will be used to estimate the denominator degrees of freedom.
7.3.2. Key Secondary Endpoint Analyses
All key secondary endpoints will be analyzed similarly as the primary endpoint.
7.3.3. Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Analysis
Blood samples will be collected for the determination of serum gefurulimab, free C5 and total C5 concentrations at the timepoints specified in the SoA. Individual serum concentrations for all participants who receive at least 1 dose of gefurulimab and who have evaluable PK/PD data will be used to summarize PK/PD parameters for gefurulimab. Descriptive statistics will be presented for all PK/PD endpoints at each sampling time. The PD effects of gefurulimab will be summarized using absolute values, change from Baseline, and percentage change from Baseline in free and total C5 serum concentrations.
7.3.4. Immunogenicity Analysis
All immunogenicity analyses will be performed on the IAS.
Immunogenicity variables include ADA status, ADA response category, and ADA incidence, ADA titer and NAb incidence over the duration of the study.
Definitions of the ADA status, response, and response titer categories will be provided in the SAP.
7.3.5. Other Safety Analysis
The safety and tolerability of gefurulimab will be assessed based on AEs and findings in clinical laboratory tests, ECG, and vital signs. Safety analyses will be performed on the SS and OLE Set based on the study period under consideration.
7.3.6. Tertiary/Exploratory Analysis
TBC
7.3.7. Interim Analysis
A non-binding interim analysis for early efficacy and futility will be performed when approximately 96 participants have completed Week 12 of the RCT Period. Enrollment of participants will proceed without interruption while the analysis is ongoing. The futility will be assessed using predictive probability of success at the end of the study. If the predictive probability of success is less than 0.0025, the DMC may recommend stopping the study early due to futility.
Hierarchical testing procedure will be followed for the testing of primary and key secondary endpoints. The overall type I error of the study for this interim and the final analysis is controlled at 1-sided 0.025 using the Lan & DeMets a-spending approximation to the O’Brien & Fleming boundaries for primary endpoint and Lan & DeMets a-spending approximation to the Pocock boundaries for key secondary endpoints.

If the p-value for the primary endpoint analysis at this interim analysis is less than 0.00381, the DMC may recommend stopping the study early due to efficacy. If the study is continued to the end after this interim analysis, the significance level for the primary analysis at the final analysis is 0.02380. If the statistical significance for the primary endpoint analysis is reached at the interim analysis, the key secondary endpoints will be tested at the one-sided significance level of 0.01771. If the statistical significance for the primary endpoint is not reached at interim but reached at the final analysis, the key secondary endpoints will be tested at the one-sided significance level of 0. 0.01286. The key secondary endpoints are tested in the order described in Section 3 until a non-significance is observed, at which point only nominal p-values will be reported.
The interim analysis will be conducted such that the ongoing study integrity is maintained. An ISC will conduct the interim analysis and investigators, participants, and the study team who are involved in the conduct of the study will remain masked to treatment assignment until the final clinical data lock. A SIP will be developed in which the masking method and unmasking process will be pre-specified.
The DMC will evaluate the interim results and make recommendations for the study as outlined in the DMC charter. Further details regarding the decision rules, roles, responsibilities, and processes of DMC during the interim analysis will be described in the DMC charter.
7.3.8. Independent Data Monitoring Committee
A DMC will be established to oversee the safety of the study participants and make appropriate recommendations regarding further study conduct based on the available data, including regular review of safety data and at planned interim analysis where early efficacy and futility will be assessed.

9. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS AND STOPPING RULES
9.1. Discontinuation of Study Intervention
In rare instances, it may be necessary for a participant to permanently discontinue the study intervention. The Investigator will notify the Medical Monitor as soon as possible of any discontinuation or consideration to discontinue the study intervention.
If a participant permanently discontinues treatment, an ET Visit should be conducted as soon as possible (see SoA in Section 8). A SFU Visit will be conducted 12 weeks (84 + 3 days) after the last dose of the study intervention for all participants.
Participants must be considered for discontinuation of the study intervention if any of the following occur:
e Serious hypersensitivity reaction with, eg, bronchospasm or other respiratory reaction requiring ventilator support, symptomatic hypotension, or serum sickness-like reaction manifesting within 14 days after administration of the study intervention
e AE that would, in the opinion of the Investigator, make continued participation in the study an unacceptable risk
e Severe uncontrolled infection
e Concomitant use of disallowed medication
e Pregnancy or planning of a pregnancy
e Investigator or Alexion deems discontinuation to be in the best interest of the participant
The reason for treatment discontinuation will be recorded in the eCRF. If study intervention is discontinued because of a participant’s pregnancy, the Investigator will make a reasonable attempt to follow up, in accordance with local laws and regulations, until the outcome of the pregnancy is known.
Participants who discontinue the study intervention will not be replaced.

9.2. Participant Withdrawal from the Study
All efforts should be made to ensure prospective participants are willing to comply with the requirements of study participation prior to conducting the screening procedures.
If feasible, the Investigator should contact Alexion and their site before withdrawing a participant or discontinuing the study intervention. The reason for participant discontinuation must be recorded in the source documents and eCRF.
A participant may withdraw from the study at any time at his/her own request or participant’s legal guardian’s request, or may be withdrawn at any time at the discretion of the Investigator for safety, behavioral, compliance, or administrative reasons. Participant withdrawals are expected to be uncommon.
At the time of early withdrawal from the study, an ET Visit should be conducted as soon as possible as shown in the SoA (Section 8). Additionally, a Safety Follow-up Visit should be performed 12 weeks (+ 3 days) following the last administration of the study intervention. Refer to the SoA for data to be collected at the time of study discontinuation and follow-up, and for any further evaluations that need to be completed.
If the participant withdraws from the study, Alexion may retain and continue to use any samples collected before such a withdrawal of consent for the purposes the participant originally consented unless the participant withdraws consent for use of samples already collected. If the participant specifically withdraws consent for any use of samples, it must be documented in the site study records by the Investigator and the Investigator must inform the Local and Global Study Team. Destruction of any samples taken and not yet tested should be carried out in line with documented sample withdrawal wishes in conjunction with what was stated in the informed consent and local regulation.
The legal guardian and the pediatric participant have the right to withdraw permission (consent or assent, respectively) at any time during the study. If the study staff identify any reluctance in the legal guardian or pediatric participant (eg, signs of verbal or physical dissent) about continued participation in the study, the pediatric participant’s continuation in the study should be re-evaluated. The same principles that govern permission/assent/consent also govern its withdrawal.
Participants who withdraw or are withdrawn from the study will not be replaced.
participant will be withdrawn from the study for any of the following reasons:
A
Withdrawal of consent or assent if applicable (A pediatric participant’s dissent should be respected.)
Lost to Follow-up
A participant will be considered lost to follow-up if the participant repeatedly fails to return for scheduled visits and cannot be contacted by the study site.

e The site must attempt to contact the participant to reschedule the missed visit as soon as possible, counsel the participant on the importance of maintaining the assigned visit schedule, and ascertain whether or not the participant wishes to and should continue in the study.
e Before a participant is deemed lost to follow-up, the Investigator or designee must make every effort to regain contact with the participant (where possible, 3 telephone calls and, if necessary, a certified letter to the participant’s last known mailing address or local equivalent methods). These contact attempts should be documented in the participant’s medical record.
e Should the participant continue to be unreachable, they will be considered lost to follow-up.

10. CLINICAL LABORATORY TESTS
e The Investigator must review the laboratory report, document this review, and record any clinically relevant changes occurring during the study in the AE section of the eCRF. The laboratory reports must be filed with the source documents. Clinically significant abnormal laboratory findings are those which are not associated with the underlying disease, unless judged by the Investigator to be more severe than expected for the participant’s condition.
e All laboratory tests with abnormal values and considered clinically significant by the Investigator during the study should be repeated until the values return to normal or Baseline or are no longer considered clinically significant by the Investigator or Medical Monitor.
— Ifsuch values do not return to normal/Baseline within a period of time judged reasonable by the Investigator, the etiology should be identified, and the Medical Monitor notified.
— All protocol-required laboratory assessments, must be collected in accordance with the Laboratory Manual and the SoA.
— Laboratory assessments performed at the institution’s local laboratory or central laboratory that require a change in participant management or are considered clinically significant by the Investigator must be recorded in the AE or SAE form. When possible, values outside of the reference range should be entered, eg, in a free text field.
10.1. Virus Serology
Testing for HIV-1 and HIV-2 is required for all participants prior to Randomization. Participants who are positive for HIV antibodies will not be randomized.
Similarly, participants who are positive for HBsAg, positive anti-HBc with negative anti-HBs, or HCV antibodies will not be randomized unless successful treatment and, if locally available, SVR are documented.
10.2. Urinalysis
Urine samples will be analyzed for the parameters listed in protocol. A microscopic examination of urine samples will be performed if the results of the macroscopic analysis are abnormal.
10.3. Follicle-stimulating Hormone
FSH may be obtained to confirm postmenopausal status in female participants who are considered postmenopausal. A high FSH level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal state in women not using hormonal contraception or HRT.
This test is not needed in participants of childbearing potential.

(Mitigations prior to the CRDC meeting: Implement frequent monitoring for adherence via patient diaries and reminders; Develop age-specific consent/assent training and materials to ensure comprehension; Involve caregivers in consent discussions) Risk 2: Diplopia/ptosis - reading of Risk 2: Mitigate consent. Informed consent is read out. Discussion on 02092025: Diplopia or Ptosis will not compromise consent comprehension or PRO completion because we are able to consent people who are severely visually compromised. Consents are just read out to them by someone else and then we ask for comprehension. Consent would be read out to people who need help. PROs could be completed by asking them over the phone for remote visits. If they have ptosis, it's painful when you are lifting one eyelid. In case anybody has severe ptosis, we can always ask the questions and then the administrator can note down the responses. Risk 3: Diagnostic Misclassification: Risk 3: Mitigate Risk of enrolling patients with generalized MG Low risk. Train sites on oMG-specific symptoms to reduce misclassification at screening. Clarify symptoms criteria in protocol. No adjudication committee.

However, we include only ACHR positive patients, therefore there is no need for any adjudication committee. This would add an additional burden on the sponsor's side. Risk 4: Mitigate-Following the CDRC discussion the study will now be recruiting only adults -PCS is revised to reflect this change (note added on Sept 17, 2025) (Mitigations prior to CDRC meeting: Target recruitment in regions with higher adolescent oMG prevalence; Collaborate with pediatric neurology networks and advocacy groups).

Risk Category Risk Description Risk Response (Accept/Mitigate) Discuss at rDRC (Yes/No) Discussion: School coordination - providing a letter to school administration, if their school knows, it would be less burdensome for the pediatric participants to explain things to the school, why were they absent or why were they missing part or full of the school day. It might be beneficial to suggest pediatric patients discuss it with their school attendance to avoid dropping out or facing difficulties at school because of trial participation.] Stratification RISK 1: Age Stratification: Failure to stratify by age (adolescent vs. adult) RISK 2: Baseline disease characteristics Imbalance: Uncontrolled disease severity differences confound efficacy. Risk 1: Mitigate-Following the CDRC discussion the study will now be recruiting only adults -PCS is revised to reflect this change (note added on Sept 17, 2025) [Prior to CDRC discussion this risk was accepted with the rationale noted below: No age stratification adopted for this study. Rationale: Given the size of this study, only up to 2 stratification factors are recommended (region and steroid use). The number of adolescents enrolled is expected to be low given the rarity of this population. Adding age stratification on top of the other 2 factors will create sparse strata and undermine study power and therefore not adopted. Typically, adolescents were treated in an open label setting in other MG pediatric studies. Even if imbalance is present during RCT period, OLE data of placebo adolescent patients will be collected which adds to the totality of adolescent efficacy data of Gefurulimab.)] Risk 2: Mitigate Subgroup analyses will be planned in SAP; Sensitivity analysis can be performed further to adjust for these covariates. Discussion: For the study with sample size like only 100 or so, it’s recommended that we should only have up to two stratification factors to avoid sparse strata.

Train participants on study intervention administration before self-administering at home. Certification will be acquired. Discussion 02092025: This is part of the PCS-Participants have to be trained and certified before self-administering at home. Discussion 04092025: Highlighted the risk of incorrect self-administration, even with training and certification of participants. Potential issues included incorrect needle insertion angle, incomplete plunger depression, and premature needle activation. Referenced positive feedback from the Prevail study (GMG study), where device performance metrics showed high rates of successful administration. The team agreed this risk is low based on Prevail study outcomes, with no significant differences anticipated for the ocular population using the same device. Mitigation remains focused on training and certification (“Concerns were raised about adolescents (ages 12-14) self-administering and whether caregivers would assist. It was noted that certification is required but it is not specified by age who would administer, suggesting caregivers are likely to assist younger adolescents” - n/a after removing the pediatric population from the protocol.)

Mitigate No MG RISK 2: Incorrect administration order (PRO before exam) at Baseline and Week 12. RISK 3: Missing data on MGII (Myasthenia Gravis Impairment Index) item scores and total scores (ocular or generalized) at critical time points (Day 1 and Week 12). If more than 3 items are missing for the same assessment, the assessment may be invalid. Train and certify raters. Train patients and caregivers on PRO tool use to ensure accurate reporting over the recall period. Discussion: It was noted that while the symptoms are subjective to the patient, the Patient-Reported Outcome (PRO) tool (MGI) used as the primary outcome measure captures data over a 7-14 days recall period, reducing variability. It was clarified that variability is inherent to myasthenia gravis (MG), not specifically ocular symptoms, suggesting a reframing of the risk to "variable symptoms in ocular MG." PRO tool is validated for its intended purpose. Central adjudication of videos was deemed infeasible. Risk 2: Mitigate Use of PRO tools to capture timing of assessment that might be entered in eCRF (or use of ePRO). Administration order to be depicted in the CSP. Train the sites accordingly. Discussion: It was confirmed that PRO must be completed before exams, and the wording needed adjustment to clarify this as the correct order. Further discussion on capturing the timing of assessment in the eCRF is deferred to the IQRMP sessions with data management. Risk 3: Mitigate High risk Explicit methodology will be added to the CSP.

Training for participants and sites on reporting device issues. Addressing issues like bubbles in devices, which caused perceived failures in Prevail. Updating IFUs to avoid confusion, building on updates made during Prevail; Ensure visibility of expiry dates on labels for both patients and sites, with systems to track and communicate expirations. Sending home additional kits increases the risk of using expired kits as providing extra kits introduces this secondary risk. Discussion 05092025: Additional study intervention kits are provided at home to account for potential failures. device failures occurred a few times in Prevail, necessitating kit replacements. This introduced a secondary risk of patients retaining expired kits or not returning them, leading to potential misuse. In Prevail, kits were returned to the site after use, and new backups were dispensed, minimizing the risk of expired kit usage. One notable case in Spain involved a patient using an expired kit, but data supported an extended expiry, avoiding serious consequences. The risk of expired kit usage is distinct from device failure itself, as providing extra kits introduces this secondary risk. It was confirmed that 1-3 extra kits per dose were provided in Prevail (one kit per dose if multiple doses were at home). The team agreed this remains necessary despite the risk.
