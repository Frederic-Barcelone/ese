The table maps out when various efficacy measures (like MGII, MG-ADL, NEI-VFQ-25) and safety assessments will be conducted across 16 study visits, alternating between clinic visits (C) and remote visits (R). The comprehensive assessment schedule includes multiple myasthenia gravis-related outcome measures and quality of life questionnaires administered at specific timepoints throughout the trial duration.",

The schedule includes provisions for early termination or clinical deterioration, with a mix of clinic visits (C) and remote visits (R) to optimize patient monitoring while maintaining study rigor.",

The schedule shows a systematic approach to data collection with biomarker sampling at key intervals (visits 2, 6, 10, 14, and clinical deterioration) and regular safety monitoring throughout the study period.",

The schedule alternates between clinic visits (C) and remote visits (R), with specific timing windows and assessment batteries planned for each visit type.",

The table outlines the timing and requirements for various study visits, alternating between clinic visits (C) and remote visits (R), with specific assessments including injection site monitoring, adverse event tracking, concomitant medications, and hospitalization status. The schedule shows systematic monitoring over approximately one year, with visit windows becoming more flexible (±2 days) in later stages compared to earlier visits (±1 day).",

Discussion on 02092025: Diplopia or Ptosis will not compromise consent comprehension or PRO completion because we are able to consent people who are severely visually compromised. Consents are just read out to them by someone else and then we ask for comprehension. Consent would be read out to people who need help. PROs could be completed by asking them over the phone for remote visits. If they have ptosis, it's painful when you are lifting one eyelid.",
