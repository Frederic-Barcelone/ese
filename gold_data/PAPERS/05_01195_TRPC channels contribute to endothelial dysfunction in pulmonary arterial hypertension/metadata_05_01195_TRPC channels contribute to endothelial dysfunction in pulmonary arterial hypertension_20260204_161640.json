  "long_description": "This clinical research paper examines how transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels contribute to endothelial dysfunction in pulmonary arterial hypertension, a rare and fatal pulmonary vascular disease. The study analyzes four TRPC channels (TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6) expressed in human pulmonary endothelial cells from both control subjects and PAH patients. Through knockdown experiments, the researchers demonstrate that TRPC1 and TRPC4 are involved in store-operated calcium entry, while TRPC1 and TRPC3 are essential for cell proliferation. The findings suggest that TRPC channels, particularly TRPC1, are crucial for maintaining pulmonary endothelial cell function in PAH and represent potential therapeutic targets for reducing endothelial dysfunction in this disease.",
