Abstract
Background-Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is a rare, fatal, and progressive pulmonary vascular disease. Pulmonary endothelial cell dysfunction is a hallmark of PAH, defined by excessive proliferation and dysregulated angiogenesis, along with imbalanced production and release of vasoactive substances, growth factors, and mediators of coagulation and inflammation. Intracellular calcium (Ca?*) variations are essential in these processes. Among the various channels involved in Ca** homeostasis, transient receptor potential canonical channels (TRPC1 to 7) are known to be essential for endothelial cells of various origins, but their role in PAH remains unknown.
Results-We found that four TRPC channels (TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6) were expressed in human pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) from control and PAH patients. By knocking down each of these channels in hPECs isolated from PAH patients (PAH-hPECs), we found that TRPC1 and TRPC4 are involved in store-operated Ca** entry (SOCE). We showed that TRPC1 and TRPC3 are essential for PAH-hPECs proliferation and that TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 are important for mitogenic crosstalk in the PAH-hPECs medium. Moreover, we showed that none of the TRPC channels is involved in the migration or in vitro tubulogenesis of PAH-hPECs. Finally, we found that TRPC1 knockdown induces changes in the mRNA expression of several genes described to be crucial for endothelial cell homeostasis.
Conclusions-These data demonstrate that TRPC channels, especially TRPC1, are essential for maintaining the hPECs function in PAH, indicating that TRPC channels are central and represent interesting candidates for reducing endothelial dysfunction in PAH.

Introduction
are expressed in the PA, and more particularly in hPECs in control and PAH patients as indicated by the co-staining with von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Fig. 1A). To decipher the role of each expressed TRPC channel, we performed in vitro experiments using control-hPECs.
Endothelial cell dysfunction is a key contributor to the pathogenesis of pulmonary arterial (PA) hypertension (PAH), a rare and life-threatening pulmonary vascular disease defined by an increase in mean PA pressure >20 mmHg and pulmonary vascular resistance >2 Wood units. PAH affects approximately 50 individuals per million, and despite the availability of targeted therapies, 3-year mortality remains high, ranging from 30 to 55% [1].
First of all, we checked whether our cultured hPECs expressed three different endothelial markers by immunostaining (Fig. 1B). We confirmed that all hPECs expressed the vWF, VE-Cadherin, and CD31, demonstrating the endothelial phenotype of the control-hPECs. We also confirmed that hPECs do not express alphasmooth muscle actin (a-SMA), a marker of smooth muscle cell, contrary to our human PA smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) (Fig. 1B).
PAH can occur in the presence of germline mutations (heritable PAH), be associated with diseases, drugs, or toxin exposure, or even in the absence of an identifiable underlying cause (idiopathic PAH). A hallmark of PAH is the progressive and largely irreversible narrowing of small PA [2]. The underlying pathobiology of PAH is multifactorial, and pulmonary endothelial cells (PECs) dysfunction plays a central role in PA remodeling [2]. PECs from patients with PAH (PAH-hPECs) exhibit multiple phenotypic changes, including increased susceptibility to apoptosis [3, 4], reduced angiogenic capacity [3, 5], endothelial-to-mesenchymal transition (endoMT) [6], and enhanced proliferative and migratory capacity [3, 4]. In addition, PAH-hPECs contribute to the pathogenesis of PAH by favoring the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cytokines [7]. Elevation of the intracellular calcium (Ca”*) concentration, resulting from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) Ca?* release or Ca”* influx, is central for regulating endothelial functions [8]. In endothelial cells, as in all non-excitable cells, Ca?* entry from the extracellular compartment could be mediated by store-operated Ca** entry (SOCE), store-independent Ca** entry (SICE), or stretch-activated Ca’* entry. In the pathogenesis of PAH, SOCE has been described to play a critical role in the development of PAH by contributing to the pathologi-cal phenotypes of PA smooth muscle cells (hPASMCs) [9, 10]. Depending on the cell types, the transient receptor potential canonical (TRPC) channels could be involved in all these different types of Ca”* entry [9, 11]. In recent years, pharmacological modulation of TRPC channels has been proposed as a potential therapeutic strategy to
As TRPC channels have been demonstrated to contrib-ute to Ca”* homeostasis in different types of endothelial cells, we measured the contribution of TRPC to intracel-lular Ca”* signals (Fig. 1C). SOCE was induced by depleting intracellular Ca** by applying 1 umol/L thapsigargin (Tg) (SERCA pump inhibitor) in a Ca”*-free medium and then by adding 2 mmol/L extracellular Ca”*. To elicit the contribution of each channel, we used a small interfering RNA (siRNA) strategy. The efficacy of each siRNA was previously validated [13]. 72 h after cell transfection, we found that the knockdown of TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 had no impact on ER Ca** release (Fig. 1D). The knockdown of TRPC4 decreased SOCE, whereas the knockdown of TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 had no impact on SOCE (Fig. 1E) in control-hPECs.
We performed experiments to measure the contribution of each SOC channel to Ca’* signaling induced by the activation of the G protein-coupled receptor with 1 umol/L of histamine (Fig. 1F). We found that the knockdown of TRPC1 and TRPC4 reduced histamine-mediated Ca?* response, where neither siTRPC3 nor siTRPC6 altered histamine-induced Ca’* signaling in control-hPECs (Fig. 1G).
Moreover, we found that TRPC3 and TRPC4 are involved in control-hPECs proliferation (Fig. 1H) and that TRPC1 and TRPC6 are involved in migration (Fig. 11).
The expression of TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 increased in PAH-hPECs compared to control patients
counteract PAH development [10, 12-14].
We investigated the expression, localization, and functional role of TRPC channels in hPECs isolated from control and PAH patients, focusing on their involvement in intracellular Ca”* signaling and their contribution to proliferation, migration, and in vitro tubulogenesis in PAH-hPECs.
Similarly, to control lungs, we found by immunostaining in lungs from PAH patients that TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 are expressed in the PA (co-staining with vWF) (Fig. 2A). To assess the protein expression of TRPC channels, we performed immunoblots on control-and PAH-hPECs. We found an increased protein expression of TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 in PAH compared with control-hPECs, while TRPC3 protein expression was unchanged (Fig. 2B).

(Fig. 3C) were unchanged in PAH-hPECs compared to control-hPECs, while histamine-induced Ca’* signaling was reduced in PAH-hPECs compared to control-hPECs (Fig. 3D-E).
Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor Gamma Coactivator 1-Alpha (PPARGC1A), Endothelin receptor type A (EDNRA) and Angiotensin II Receptor Type 1 (AGTR1) (Fig. 6A). Moreover, no significant change was observed in the expression of the other 80 endothelial markers (Table 3). These results suggest that TRPC1 partly contributes to endothelial dysfunction in PAH disease. We also found that TRPC3 knockdown increased mRNA expression of TNF Receptor Superfamily Member 5 (CD40) (Fig. 6B) and that TRPC4 knockdown reduced the mRNA level of Histone Deacetylase 5 (HDAC5) (Fig. 6C) without significantly affecting the expression of other endothelial markers. TRPC6 knockdown did not induce a change in mRNA of these 90 endothelial markers (data not shown).
TRPC knockdown reduces PAH-hPECs dysfunction
In PAH-hPECs, the knockdown of TRPC1 and TRPC3 decreased ER Ca?* release (Fig. 4A-B). Moreover, we found that siTRPC1 and siTRPC4 reduced SOCE amplitude, while siTRPC3 and siTRPC6 did not affect SOCE (Fig. 4A, C). In addition, we found that siTRPC6 increased histamine-mediated Ca** response (Fig. 4D-E), suggesting a restraining role of TRPC6 in this response.
Because PAH-hPECs are characterized by a reduction in their migratory and angiogenic capacities, we investigated whether TRPC isoforms were involved in these processes. 72 h after PAH-hPECs transfection, we found that none of the TRPC channels were involved in PAH-hPECs migration (Fig. 5A) or angiogenic capacity (Fig. 5B). BrdU assay showed that among all TRPCs, only the knockdown of TRPC1 and TRPC3 reduced PAH-hPECs proliferation by about 30% (Fig. 5C). We also evaluated the crosstalk between PAH—-hPECs and control-hPASMCs. We measured the proliferation capacity of control-hPASMCs in the presence of culture medium from PAH-hPECs transfected with siTRPC1, siTRPC3, siTRPC4, or siTRPC6. We found that TRPC3, TRPC4, or TRPC6 knockdown decreased this mitogenic crosstalk in the PAH-hPECs medium (Fig. 5D).
Discussion
Endothelial dysfunction and the involvement of SOC channels are crucial for the development of PAH. However, the role of TRPC channels in control-and PAH-hPECs was unknown. This work investigated the expression, the location, and the role of SOC channels in Ca** signaling in hPECs from control and PAH patients. We also assessed the involvement of TRPC channels in cell proliferation, cell migration, in vitro tube formation, and the regulation of endothelial markers in hPECs from PAH patients. Finally, our study highlighted their participation in the development of the pathology by participating in the control of pulmonary endothelial cell homeostasis.
Endothelial dysfunction in PAH
TRPC channel knockdown in PAH-hPECs induces numerous modifications in the expression of genes involved in endothelial cell homeostasis
The modulation of arterial tone by endothelial cells during pathological processes is currently well understood and represents the target of known therapies in the treatment of PAH. Under physiological conditions, hPECs are generally in a quiescent state. By contrast, in a pathologi-cal state, such as PAH, several studies demonstrated that PAH-hPECs developed increased migratory capacity and hyperproliferation, resulting in PA obstruction [3, 4]. The overproduction of several growth factors is a key feature of pulmonary endothelial dysfunction in PAH,
To better understand the role played by TRPC channels in PAH-hPECs, we quantified the expression of 90 endothelial markers by RT-qPCR assay. We found that TRPC1 knockdown increased mRNA expression of CD40 Ligand (CD40LG), Interleukin 1 Beta (IL-1B), Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF), prostaglan-din F receptor (PTGFR), Angiopoietin 1 (ANGPT1), Leptin (LEP) Interferon Regulatory Factor 3 (IRF3),

increased ability to proliferate and migrate, PAH-hPECs developed a reduced capacity for angiogenesis, as evidenced by decreased in vitro tube formation and disorga-nization compared to control patients [3, 5, 19]. In PAH, endothelial dysfunction contributes to the recruitment of pro-inflammatory cells through the overproduction of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IL-la and IL-6, as well as other pro-inflammatory mediators such as leptin
leading to the proliferation and excessive migration of hPASMCs, pulmonary vascular progenitors, and pericytes [15-17]. In association with this change in endothelial phenotype, PAH-hPECs exhibited an endoMT process characterized by a progressive loss of expression of molecules involved in cell-cell interactions. This leads to endothelial barrier instability, which contributes to pulmonary vascular remodeling [3, 6, 18]. Despite the

(7, 20]. The secreted factors promote endothelial barrier instability, which facilitates immune cell infiltration [21].
In the present study, we found that control-and PAHhPECs expressed TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6. The TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 were overexpressed in PAH-hPECs compared to control-hPECs, but SOCE was similar in both groups. The histamine-induced Ca?* response, however, was reduced in PAH. Regarding the absence of a difference in SOCE between control and PAH-hPECs, we can speculate that the different mitochondrial status of PAH-hPECs vs. control-hPECs, including mitochondrial membrane potential alteration, aberrant reactive oxygen production (ROS), and glycolytic shift [22, 23], could explain why SOCE is not increased in PAH-hPECs while TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC6 are increased. Indeed, mitochondrial function is closely related to SOCE [24, 25]. Mitochondrial depolarization enhances the activity of store-operated channels, including TRPC [26]. In addition, mitochondrial

ATP can buffer Ca”*, relieving the inhibitory effect of incoming Ca”* on SOCE activity [27]. We can therefore conclude that the metabolic status of mitochondria is key to regulating intracellular ATP content, which in turn affects SOCE activity. Mitochondrial status can also influence ROS production, which can modulate TRPC channel function [28-30]. ROS are mainly handled by the mitochondria and are linked to SOCE activity [31, 32]. In addition, SOCE is a complex mechanism involving several modulating proteins, and each of them could modulate SOCE negatively and positively [33]. To our knowledge, the level of expression of these different SOCE modulating proteins is unknown in PAH-hPECs. Finally, the lipid membrane composition can also influence TRP channel function [34]. To better understand all these aspects of TRPC regulation in PAH and control-hPECs, several key experiments are necessary in further studies.

Our results showed that TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 are involved in SOCE, while only TRPC6 is involved in histamine Ca?*-mediated responses. We have shown that TRPC1, TRPC3, and TRPC4 are essential for PAH-hPECs proliferation and that TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 are important for mitogenic crosstalk. We also showed that TRPC channels do not play a role in in vitro tubulogen-esis of PAH-hPECs. However, we found that TRPC4 and TRPC6 are involved in the proliferation of control-hPECs and that TRPC1 and TRPC6 are involved in the migration of these cells. This study suggests that TRPC channels are involved in hPECs homeostasis in control-hPECs and involved in the development of the PAH phenotype of these cells.
SOC channels in endothelial dysfunction
Prior to the present study, only a few studies investigated the role of SOC channels in the functions of hPECs. Recently, Babicheva et al. showed that SOCE regulates endoMT in hPECs [35]. In mouse PECs, TRPC1 and

TRPC4 strongly contribute to SOCE and endothelial barrier integrity [36, 37]. As in murine PECs, in PAHhPECs, TRPC1 and TRPC4 are involved in SOCE, and TRPC1 and TRPC3 play a role in cell proliferation. We also showed that TRPCs are not involved in migration or in vitro tubulogenesis of PAH-hPECs. TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 are important for mitogenic crosstalk in the PAH-hPECs medium.
In addition, we found that TRPC1 knockdown in PAH-hPECs induced increased expression of more than 10 genes involved in inflammatory signaling, regulation of vasomotor activity, and endothelial cell migration. Altogether, these findings indicate that TRPC channels contribute to endothelial dysfunction occurring in PAH.
Furthermore, we found that TRPC4 is overexpressed in PAH-hPECs and plays a role in SOCE in both control- and PAH-hPECs. Previous studies have shown that TRPC4 is involved in the increased permeability of lung endothelial cells in both control and experimental

exposed to Sugen/hypoxia, knocking down TRPC4 using an adeno-associated virus reduced both right ventricu-lar systolic pressure and right ventricular hypertrophy [39]. This study demonstrated the potential of targeting TRPC4 in endothelial cells to reduce PAH. As in PASMCs or other cell types, including PECs, Ca* signaling is necessary for almost all cellular functions, including prolif-eration, migration, contraction, and gene transcription [8]. Given that PAH is characterized by pulmonary endothelial dysfunction, it is important to analyze the consequences of SOC channel inhibition on the phenotype of hPECs. In addition to the beneficial effects of SOC channel inhibitors on PAH-hPASMCs phenotypes, the present study demonstrated that SOC channel inhibition may also partly reduce endothelial dysfunction.

Conclusions
Using primary hPECs from control and patients suffering from PAH, we found that hPECs express TRPC1, TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6. TRPC1, TRPC4, and TRPC6 are involved in Ca’* signaling of PAH-hPECs. We showed that TRPC1 and TRPC3 are essential for PAH-hPECs proliferation and that TRPC3, TRPC4, and TRPC6 are important for mitogenic crosstalk in the PAH-hPECs medium. Finally, we found that TRPC1 is crucial for endothelial cell homeostasis. Together, these results demonstrate that TRPC channels are central and represent very interesting candidates for reducing endothelial dysfunction in PAH.

reports demonstrated that STIM1 could interact and activate TRPC1 and TRPC4 channels [43] directly, we supposed that in PAH-hPECs, TRPC1 and TRPC4 are involved in SOCE via STIM1 interaction during ER Ca”* depletion.

Cells were isolated as previously described [44-46] and were used for the study between passages 3 and 5. Patients studied were part of a program approved by our institutional Ethics Committee and had given written informed consent (ID RCB: 2018-A01252-53).

were cultured in DMEM (Gibco, ref 11960044) supple-mented with 12,5% FCS, 2 mmol/L L-Glutamine, 1X Insulin-Transferin-Selenium, 100 U/mL penicillin-streptomycin, 20 mmol/L HEPES, 10 ng/mL EGF.
Clinical data of control and PAH patients used for the study are summarized in Table 1.
SIRNA transfection
hPECs were transfected in suspension by incubating 4x10° cells in a solution containing 1000 pL of OptiMEM (Gibco, ref 31985-062), 6 pL of Lipofectamine RNAiMax (Invitrogen, ref 13778-150), and 50 nM of a specific Silencer™ Select siRNA. All the siRNA used in the experiments are summarized in Table 2. Opti-MEM, lipofectamine, and siRNA were mixed for 20 min at room temperature. After harvesting, cells were added to the mix for 20 min. The mix was then put in cell culture dishes containing complete MCDB medium. Media were changed 24 h after transfection. All experiments were performed 72 h after hPECs transfection.
Reverse transcription-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR)
Total RNA from hPECs was isolated by using a TRIzol reagent. RNA concentration and purity were evaluated on a NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, USA) spectropho-tometer measuring absorbance at 230, 260, and 280 nm. RT was performed with a StaRT kit from Anygenes (Paris, France) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, and qPCR was performed with perfect Master Mix SYBR Green (with ROX) for SignAray 96 system from Anygenes according to the manufacturer’s protocol on a Plus Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) and analyzed with StepOne Software. For PAH-hPECs, Endothelial Dysfunction plaques (PZ75A1H1-F) were used. All the primers used are summarized in Table 3.
Western blot analyses
Total proteins (20 yg) from hPECs or human lung-tissue samples were prepared as described previously [47]. Antibodies used for Western blot experiments are listed in Table 4.
Intracellular Ca2* measurements
hPECs were plated on 18-mm glass coverslips and loaded with 2 mol/L Fura-2-AM dissolved in DMSO plus 20% pluronic acid (Life Technologies) and then incubated at 37 °C for 30 min in darkness in Krebs solution (in mmol/L: 135 NaCl, 5.9 KCI, 2 CaCl,, 1 MgCl, 10 HEPES, 10 D-glucose) at pH 7.4. Loaded cells were washed twice with the physiological solution before imaging. Ca’* images were obtained using a microscope

Pulmonary vascular cells proliferation measurement
Pulmonary vascular cells proliferation measurement To evaluate cell proliferation, we visualized 5-bromo- 2’-deoxyuridine (BrdU) incorporation to identify cells undergoing DNA replication using a DELFIA cell proliferation kit (AD0200, PerkinElmer). Experiments were performed according to the kit recommendations.
For cross-talk communication between PAH-hPECs and control-hPASMCs, culture medium of PAH-hPECs transfected with siControl, siTRPC1, siTRPC3, siTRPC4, or siTRPC6 was collected 72 h after transfection. The proliferation capacity of control-hPASMCs was then measured in the presence of 50% DMEM medium + 50% transfected PAH-hPECs culture medium.
In vitro tube formation assay
96-well plates were precoated with extracellular matrix gel prepared from Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) tumor cells (Clinisciences; #CBA-200). 72 h after control-hPECs transfection, 5 x 10° cells/well were seeded onto the gel. Cells were incubated for 3 h at 37 °C in the standard culture medium, and tubular network visualization was performed after staining cells with Calcein/AM dye (10 umol/L) using EVOS (Invitrogen). As previously described [46, 48], tube formation was quantified as the number of junctions, segments, and the total master segment length. The total master segment length quantifies the main extension of the network, excluding branches, while the number of junctions and segments reflects the global complexity of the network branching.
nologies
(Olympus IX71) equipped with a Sutter Fluo Lambda 421 LED system (Sutter Instrument Company, Novato, CA, USA), which rapidly changed the excitation wavelengths between 340 nm and 380 nm. Emission was measured at 510 nm.
Image acquisition in selected cells and analysis with MetaFluor® 7.8 imaging software (Molecular Devices).
Immunofluorescence staining
Lungs were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde, paraffin-embedded, and serially sectioned (5 tm). The tissue sections were deparaffinized in xylene baths before rehydration in alcohol. Epitope unmasking was performed in a pH 9 buffer using a 2100 Antigen Retriever (Aptum). The slides were saturated with 0.5 M NH,Cl for 15 min, then blocked and permeabilized for one hour at room temperature with a solution containing 1% BSA (Bovine Serum Albumin), 0.5% Triton X-100, 10% human serum, and 10% donkey serum. The anti-TRPC antibodies (1/200) and anti-vWF (1/200) antibodies were incubated overnight at 4 °C in a solution of PBS, 0.2% BSA, 0.2% Triton X-100, and 3% donkey serum. The slides were then incubated for 1 h in the dark at room temperature with a secondary antibody (1/400) donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 594 (to detect TRPC) or donkey anti-mouse Alexa 647 (to detect vWF) with 3% human serum and
Wound healing assay
We used the wound healing assay to evaluate cell migration. After 48 h of starvation (medium without growth factors: fetal calf serum (FCS), epidermal growth factor (EGF), and insulin), hPECs were plated in a culture insert (Cat. No. 90209; Ibidi) at a density of 2 x 10‘cells per well in a fresh medium with cytosine arabinoside (10 mol/L) to prevent cell proliferation. After allowing cells to attach for 24 h, we removed the culture insert and washed the cells with phosphate-buffered saline to remove non-adherent cells. Cells were transfected with corresponding siRNA 24 h before starvation (72 h before removal of culture inserts). Cell migration into the wound space was quanti-fied using ImageJ software [49]. Cell motility was assessed by the percentage of wound closure 8 h after initiation of wound healing ([(area TO - area T8) + area T8] x 100).

Statistical analyses
All statistical tests were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad, version 9.0 for Windows). After checking with the Shapiro—Wilk normality test to see whether the sample data followed a normal distribution, differences between the two were assessed using an unpaired t-test or Mann-Whitney test when conditions of parametric tests were not met. Kruskal-Wallis tests with post hoc Dunn were used to compare three or more groups (all data with sample size 1 <6/group and skewed data with sample sizen 2 6/group). All values are reported as mean+standard error of the mean. Representative images/figures were chosen to represent the mean of each quantification. For all experiments, a p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant.
