  "title": "The Hidden Shunt: An Asymptomatic Atrial Septal Defect Revealed by Echocardiography in a High-Performance Teenage Football Player",
  "short_description": "A case report of a 14-year-old competitive football player with an asymptomatic atrial septal defect discovered during pre-participation cardiovascular screening and successfully treated with percutaneous device closure.",
  "long_description": "This clinical case report describes the discovery and management of an ostium secundum atrial septal defect (ASD) in a 14-year-old competitive football player during routine pre-participation cardiovascular evaluation. Despite normal clinical examination and electrocardiogram findings, transthoracic echocardiography revealed the congenital heart defect with mildly enlarged right chambers and a Qp/Qs ratio of 1.7. The case demonstrates the successful percutaneous closure of the ASD using a device occlusion technique, with follow-up showing appropriate device positioning and regression of right-heart dilation. The report emphasizes the potential value of echocardiographic screening in high-level young athletes to detect silent structural cardiac abnormalities that may not be clinically apparent but could lead to long-term complications if left untreated.",
