  "title": "Merck Receives Positive EU CHMP Opinion for Expanded Use of WINREVAIR™ (sotatercept) in Adults with Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension",
  "short_description": "Merck announces positive CHMP recommendation for expanded WINREVAIR indication in PAH patients, including WHO Functional Class IV, based on Phase 3 ZENITH trial results showing 76% reduction in morbidity and mortality risk.",
  "long_description": "This news release announces that the European Medicines Agency's Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) has recommended approval of an expanded indication for WINREVAIR™ (sotatercept) for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in adult patients with WHO Functional Class II, III, and IV. The recommendation is based on the Phase 3 ZENITH study, which demonstrated a statistically significant 76% reduction in major morbidity and mortality outcomes when WINREVAIR was added to background therapy. The current EU indication covers WHO FC II-III patients for exercise capacity improvement, while the expanded indication would include FC IV patients and recognize the drug's impact on morbidity and mortality beyond exercise capacity. WINREVAIR is the first and only activin signaling inhibitor therapy approved for PAH in Europe and is currently approved in more than 50 countries.",
