  "short_description": "A clinical practice guide for healthcare professionals on recognizing, diagnosing, and managing ANCA associated vasculitis, a group of multi-system autoimmune small vessel diseases.",
  "long_description": "This BMJ clinical practice document provides comprehensive guidance on ANCA associated vasculitis (AAV), which encompasses microscopic polyangiitis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, and eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis. The guide emphasizes the importance of early recognition of AAV in patients presenting with chronic systemic symptoms and multi-organ involvement, particularly affecting the kidneys, lungs, upper airways, eyes, and peripheral nerves. It includes a case study of a 44-year-old patient presenting with fatigue and night sweats who was subsequently diagnosed with AAV, and provides practical advice for healthcare professionals on when to suspect the condition, key diagnostic tests including urinalysis and ANCA testing, and urgent referral criteria for patients with concerning symptoms such as haemoptysis.",
