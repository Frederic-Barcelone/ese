  "title": "Gastrointestinal involvement in granulomatosis with polyangiitis: frequency, clinical impact, and prognostic implications in a retrospective cohort study",
  "short_description": "A retrospective study of 220 GPA patients examining gastrointestinal manifestations, their frequency (8.2%), and association with increased disease severity and mortality.",
  "long_description": "This retrospective cohort study analyzes gastrointestinal involvement in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) patients treated at Amir Alam Hospital between 2013-2021. The research examines 220 confirmed GPA cases to determine the frequency and clinical impact of gastrointestinal manifestations. The study found that 8.2% of patients experienced GI involvement, with the most common manifestations being hepatitis, mesenteric ischemia, diarrhea, pancreatitis, and elevated liver enzymes. Patients with GI involvement demonstrated significantly higher Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Scores, increased mortality risk (hazard ratio 3.24), and shorter time to first relapse compared to those without GI symptoms. The findings suggest that gastrointestinal involvement in GPA is associated with more severe disease activity and poorer prognosis, emphasizing the importance of early detection and appropriate management of GI manifestations to improve clinical outcomes.",
