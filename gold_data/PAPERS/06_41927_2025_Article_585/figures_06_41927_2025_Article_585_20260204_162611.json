The left panel shows overall survival and the right panel shows relapse-free survival over follow-up periods of up to 100 months and 60 months respectively. Both curves demonstrate significantly worse outcomes for the GI involvement positive group (red line) compared to the negative group (blue line), with steeper declines in both overall survival and relapse-free survival rates. The survival curves show clear separation between groups, indicating GI involvement is associated with poorer prognosis.",

The algorithm starts with patients diagnosed with vasculitis and uses sequential criteria including ACR (American College of Rheumatology) guidelines, biopsy results, and ANCA testing to differentiate between EGPA (Eosinophilic Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis), GPA (Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis), MPA (Microscopic Polyangiitis), and PAN (Polyarteritis Nodosa). Each decision point leads to either a specific vasculitis classification or continues to the next diagnostic criterion, with cases that don't meet any criteria being labeled as 'Unclassified'.",
