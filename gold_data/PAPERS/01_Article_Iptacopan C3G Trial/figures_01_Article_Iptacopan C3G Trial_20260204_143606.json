      "title": "Iptacopan Effects on Complement Biomarkers Over Time",
      "description": "This is a multi-panel line graph showing the percentage change from baseline for three complement biomarkers over a 360-day study period. The study includes a double-blind period (baseline to day 180) followed by an open-label period, comparing iptacopan treatment (blue circles) versus placebo (red triangles). Iptacopan demonstrates sustained and dramatic reductions in plasma sC5b-9 (~70% decrease) and urinary sC5b-9:creatinine (~85% decrease), while significantly increasing serum C3 levels (~200% increase), indicating effective complement pathway inhibition. The placebo group shows minimal changes across all biomarkers, and patients switching from placebo to iptacopan in the open-label period show similar beneficial effects.",

The bar chart demonstrates that iptacopan significantly reduced proteinuria by 30.2% at 6 months compared to a 7.6% increase with placebo (p=0.0014). The line graph tracks changes over 12 months, showing sustained reduction in the iptacopan group during both double-blind and open-label periods, with maintained efficacy of approximately 40% reduction from baseline at 12 months.",
