BACKGROUND: Imaging technique has emerged as an innovative tool for diagnosing and monitoring patients with pulmonary hypertension (PH). Current studies in radiomics primarily focus on hemodynamics and cardiac function, whereas the assessment of pulmonary vessels is often neglected. This study aims to investigate the diagnostic and prognostic value of computed tomography pulmonary vascular radiomics in PH.
METHODS: This multicenter study enrolled 193 patients with PH and 193 controls (102 symptomatic non-PH cases and 91 healthy volunteers) for diagnostic analysis, with external validation in 38 patients with PH and 38 controls. For prognostic analysis, 166 patients with PH were prospectively followed (median follow-up: 16months; 96 clinical deterioration events), with external validation in 32 patients with PH (median follow-up: 7 months; 11 events). Pulmonary vascular radiomics features extracted from chest computed tomography were used to develop predictive models for PH diagnosis and prognosis.
RESULTS: The diagnostic model integrating 7 radiomic and 3 clinical features achieved an area under the curve of 0.984 (95% Cl, 0.959-0.995) in the derivation cohort and 0.980 (0.901-1.000) in external validation. For exploratory pulmonary arterial hypertension subtyping, the model incorporating 8 radiomic and 2 clinical features yielded an area under the curve of 0.898 (0.825-0.972) internally and 0.877 (0.352-1.000) externally. The prognostic radiomic-clinical model outperformed the European Society of Cardiology 4-strata risk assessment, with a 2-year area under the curve of 0.866 (0.8-0.942) versus 0.709 (0.648-0.789).
CONCLUSIONS: The radiomics-based models have strong diagnostic and prognostic capabilities for PH and can also successfully differentiate pulmonary arterial hypertension. This suggests the potential of radiomics to discern PH with different clinical risks, which may facilitate personalized drug therapy.

CLINICAL PERSPECTIVE
What Is New?
We developed computed tomography-based radiomics models that achieve high diagnos-tic accuracy for pulmonary hypertension and effectively differentiate pulmonary arterial hypertension from other pulmonary hypertension subtypes.
Therefore, the integration of NCCT radiomic analysis with clinical data may provide a novel approach or the noninvasive identification of PH disease progression, ultimately informing treatment decisions and improving patient outcomes. The purpose of this study was to establish diagnostic and prognostic models for PH by extracting radiomic features from the pulmonary vascular region and to assess their clinical utility and easibility.
Our prognostic radiomics model demonstrates superior performance in predicting clinical outcomes of patients with pulmonary hypertension compared with the European Society of Cardiology simplified 4-strata risk assessment tool.
METHODS
What Are the Clinical Implications?
By quantifying vascular heterogeneity, computed tomography pulmonary vascular radiomics enables semiautomated, noninvasive detection and risk stratification of pulmonary hypertension, thereby providing a foundation for guiding personalized treatment strategies.
Study Design and Participants
The data set used and analyzed in this study is available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request. This multicenter study involved a retrospective derivation cohort (January 2019—December 2021; Renji Hospital affiliated to Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine and Zhongshan Hospital affiliated to Fudan University) and a prospective validation cohort (January 2022-June 2022; the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University, Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital and the Second Affiliated Hospital of the Third Military Medical University). PH was defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure >25mmHg on RHC. The control group without PH consisted of symptomatic patients exhibiting PH-like clinical or radiologic manifestations (main pulmonary artery diameter [PA] >29mm or ratio of the PA and the aorta diameter [PA/ AO] =1) alongside healthy volunteers, all confirmed by RHC or echocardiography, with age-sex matching to patients with PH. Inclusion criteria of participants were (1) age between 18 and 75years old; and (2) availability of RHC, echocardiography, and noncontrast chest CT within 30 days. Exclusion criteria were pulmonary parenchymal pathology, imaging artifacts, and thoracic deformities. The clinical data were recorded, including age, sex, RHC hemodynamic, echocardiography findings, CT measurements, cardiac function grading, and clinical deterioration events.

Radiomics Measurement and Preprocessing
Diagnostic Study Pulmonary Hypertension Detection
NCCT scans were acquired following standardized imaging protocols (120kV, 5mm slice thickness) using multidetector CT scanners from 4 manufacturers: Toshiba (Aquilion series), Siemens (GOMATOM Force), GE(RevolutionCT), andUIH(UCT 760). Pulmonaryvessel segmentation was conducted using semiautomated lung masks (Chest Imaging Platform, 3D Slicer, https:// download. slicer.org/bitstream/614aca0a342a877 cb3c65630),”° followed by vessel enhancement via the Frangni filter*'*? via Matlab R2021a. The results of pulmonary vessel segmentation from chest CT are illustrated in Figure 2. A total of 944 radiomic feature extractions (Pyradiomics, Python 3.0)'? were derived from original and transformed pulmonary vessels images through wavelet decomposition and Laplacian of Gaussian filtering followed the Image Biomarker
Cross-group comparison and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analyses selected discriminative radiomic and clinical features between patients with PH and controls. Various machine learning methods, including the support vector machines classifier, logistic regression classifier (LRC), and random forests classifier were used to establish the diagnostic models. Radiomic models were established using only radiomics features, whereas joint models (JM) combined these features with clinical data.
The optimal model was compared with the 2 most commonly used noninvasive estimation models: echocardiographic measured tricuspid regurgitation velocity (.RC_TRV) and CT-measured diameter ratio of the main pulmonary artery and the aorta (LRC_PA/AO).

Univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression analyses identified predic-tors of clinical deterioration. Multivariate Cox regression was used to develop prognostic models, with calculated risk scores stratifying high-risk and low-risk groups.
Within the cohort with PH, we conducted an embedded subgroup analysis comparing PAH against other PH subtypes. To address class imbalance, the synthetic minority oversampling technique algorithm was used in the training set. Identical feature extraction and machine learning classifiers were applied for PAH discrimination.
The comparison of the models and the simpli-fied four-strata risk assessment tool from the 2022 European Society of Cardiology guidelines’ was assessed using DeLong’s test for correlated ROC curves and the Akaike and Bayesian information criteria.

Brier score, C-index, and calibration curve were used to evaluate the stability and bias of the models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall curves were calculated to validate the discrimi-native ability of the model.
Statistical Analysis
During descriptive analysis, quantitative variables were reported as mean+SD or median (interquartile range) according to the distribution, and categorical variables were expressed as frequency (percentage). During cross-group comparison, quantitative variables were analyzed using the t test or Mann-Whitney U test, and categorical variables were assessed using the x? test. Statistical analysis methods for the diagnostic and prognostic studies are described in the corresponding Methods subsections. A P value <0.05 indicates statisti-cal significance. To ensure the robustness of the model, internal validation was performed using a 10-repeat, 5- fold cross-validation scheme, with performance metrics reported along with their 95% Cls across all iterations.

Prognostic Study
The primary end point for this prognostic study was clinical deterioration-free survival, defined as the time from the date of the baseline CT examination to the first occurrence of any of the following events, with follow-up censored at December 31, 2023: (1) all-cause mortality, (2) lung transplantation, (3) readmission due to worsening of PH, and (4) escalation of PH-targeted therapy. For patients who did not experience any event, data were right censored at the date of their last known follow-up.
Additionally, for the time-dependent ROC analysis, binary outcomes for clinical deterioration were defined

Prognostic Model
Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression identified 6 radiomic features for the radiomic prognostic model and 8 combined radiomic-clinical features for the joint model (Figure S6, Table S10). Patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk groups using calculated risk scores, with high gray-level zone emphasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.3 95% Cl, 1.02-1.50) and right ventricular basal diameter (RV; HR, 1.04 95% Cl, 1.01-1.10) demonstrating independent prognostic significance (Figure 6)

The LRC_JM model exhibited significantly superior discriminative performance over conventional predic-ion models, achieving higher AUC values than both he TRV model (AUC, 0.980 [95% Cl, 0.956-0.993]; DeLong's test, P<0.05; see Table S5) and the PA/AO model (AUC, 0.855 [95% Cl, 0.766-0.927]; DeLong’s est, P<0.05). This enhancement in predictive accuracy was further corroborated by likelinood ratio ests, which showed highly significant improvements when comparing the LRC_JM model to the TRV model (x°(9)=38.584, P<0.001) and the PA/AO mode (x°(9)=258.273, P<0.001), confirming that the incorpo-ration of radiomic features adds statistically significan incremental prognostic value beyond conventional parameters. Additionally, decision curve analysis demonstrated that the LRC_JM model provided greater clinical net benefit across a range of clinically relevan threshold probabilities (Figure 3D).

Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed significant differ-ences in clinical deterioration-free survival between risk groups in the derivation cohort (radiomic model: P=0.0002; joint model: P<0.0001, Figure 6B). Although the validation cohort showed comparable trends (Figure 6D), statistical significance was not reached due to limited event numbers (n=11).
The joint model showed higher time-dependent AUC values compared with the 2022 European Society of Cardiology 4-strata tool for both 1-year (AUC, 0.674 [95% Cl, 0.545—-0.746] versus 0.612 [95% Cl, 0.502— 0.712]; see Table 3) and 2-year outcomes (AUC, 0.798 [95% Cl, 0.756-0.980] versus 0.717 [95% Cl, 0.572-0.843]); however, these differences did not reach statistical significance on DeLong’s test (P=0.4825 and P=0.3647, respectively; see Table S11). Furthermore, the joint model achieved a better balance between goodness-of-fit and complexity than the European
Notably, when applied to symptomatic controls without PH, LRC_JM maintained diagnostic accuracy 0} 0.892 (95% Cl, 0.875—0.908), significantly surpassing the TRV method (accuracy, 0.823 [95% Cl, 0.803—0.844]) and PA/AO method (accuracy, 0.627 [95% Cl, 0.599—0.655)).
Shapley additive explanations analysis elucidated key predictors in the logistic regression joint mode (LRC_JM) for PH diagnosis (Figures 4A and 4B).

Our study is the first to propose the use of radiomics of pulmonary vessels from NCCT in the diagnostic and prognostic models for PH, showing superior performance compared with conventional methods that rely on existing clinical factors such as TRV and PA/AO. This could be attributed to radiom-ics providing a more realistic description of pulmonary vascular remodeling by leveraging comprehensive information about pulmonary vascular morphology.

absolute deviation and lower kurtosis of gray-level),
increased roughness (evidenced by lower autocor-relation), intricate spatial distribution patterns (charac-terized by higher contrast and lower correlation), and more uneven and busier local texture changes (evidenced by higher gray-level nonuniformity, normalized size zone nonuniformity, contrast, and busyness). The shape changes may be attributed to enlarged cardiac shadows and narrowed lung fields.*° The gray-level variations may be attributed to the augmentation in vascular bed volume and density, as well as the vascular wall remodeling induced by vascular resistance. These texture changes indicated comprehensive vascular involvement and the existence of spatial and local heterogeneity in the remodeling process,?”78 which aligns well with previous studies on pulmonary vascular morphology, which demonstrated the heterogeneity of tissue density.29 This observation is substantiated by heterogeneous heatmap patterns revealed through spatial analysis (Figure 4F). Notably, the abrupt transition in radiomic signatures variation within peripheral vasculature suggests focal architec-tural disorganization at the microvascular level, corresponding to significant occlusion and plexiform lesions in distal pulmonary vessels.°°.*!
The radiomics prognostic model effectively assesses the 1-year and 2-year outcomes of patients with PH, demonstrating superior predictive capability for long-term clinical deterioration events compared with the 4-strata risk assessment tool.
Pulmonary vascular remodeling exhibits greater prognostic capacity than cardiac function and may enhance precise clinical decision-making within the current strategies of targeted drug combination therapy.
Limitations
This study has several limitations. First, the sample size is relatively small, particularly in the prospective validation cohort, which may affect the generalizability of our findings. Second, the retrospective nature of the derivation cohort may introduce selection bias, as the data collection was dependent on the availability and quality of historical records. The high diagnostic AUC of TRV alone in our cohort may reflect spectrum bias, given that patients were referred for RHC by specialists, creating a high-risk population. Third, the incorporation of healthy control cohorts and the exclusion of individuals with pulmonary parenchymal pathologies may limit the generalizability of diagnostic performance in clinical practice, as routine medical assessment necessitates differentiation among symptomatic patients with complex comorbidities. Furthermore, given that RHC is not routinely recommended for patients with World Health Organization groups 2 and 3 PH, a potential population bias could not be avoided in our study cohort. Finally, the observation period of the prognostic cohort may be insufficient, and a longer follow-up time is needed to optimize the prognostic model.
Compared with other types of PH, PAH is character-ized by reduced left atrial diameter and increased PA.°2 In the analysis of gray-level, it is observed that PAH displays a more diverse pattern (evidenced by radiomics features: higher gray-level variance, maximum, mean, but lower 90th percentile, median, minimum); however, concentrated within the fix ranges (evidenced by higher kurtosis, Informational Measure of Correlation (IMC)). Regarding texture, PAH exhibits less regional heterogeneity (evidenced by lower difference average, small area emphasis, small area high—gray-level emphasis, short run high—gray-level emphasis, and large dependence high—gray-level emphasis). The gray-level variance may be attributed to calcification, uneven remodeling of the vessel wall, and the flow distribution between the artery and venous bed. The texture changes observed in PAH and PH also indicated the spatial heterogeneity of blood flow distribution within the pulmonary vessels.°°3!

CONCLUSIONS
In conclusion, this study successfully established radiomic models for the diagnosis and prognosis of PH through machine learning. Combining advanced radiomics techniques with clinical data provides a promising avenue to enhance the more precise noninvasive detection and individualized treatment of PH. These findings not only underscore the potential of radiom-ics in clinical settings but also pave the way for future research aimed at improving patient outcomes and quality of life.
The current pathogenetic and hemodynamic classification system facilitates the application of targeted drugs; however, it lacks utility in studying and prognosticating pathophysiological abnormalities. The majority of published studies investigating risk factors for pulmonary hypertension have predominantly focused on the imaging assessment of cardiac function, with limited exploration of pulmonary vascular-related parameters. Our prognostic studies identified significant predictors unrelated to myocardial function, such as pulmonary vascular roughness and complexity. This finding aligns with the study conducted by Cai,**
