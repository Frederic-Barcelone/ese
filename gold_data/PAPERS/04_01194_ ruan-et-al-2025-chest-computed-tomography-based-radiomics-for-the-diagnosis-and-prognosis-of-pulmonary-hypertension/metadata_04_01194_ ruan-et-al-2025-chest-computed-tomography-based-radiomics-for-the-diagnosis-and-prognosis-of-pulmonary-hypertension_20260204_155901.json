  "short_description": "A multicenter study investigating the diagnostic and prognostic value of CT-based radiomics models for pulmonary hypertension, demonstrating superior performance compared to traditional risk assessment methods.",
  "long_description": "This multicenter clinical research study evaluates the application of chest computed tomography-based radiomics for diagnosing and predicting outcomes in pulmonary hypertension (PH). The research enrolled 193 PH patients and 193 controls for diagnostic analysis, with additional cohorts for external validation and prognostic assessment. The study developed machine learning models incorporating radiomic features extracted from pulmonary vascular imaging combined with clinical parameters. Results showed exceptional diagnostic performance with area under the curve values exceeding 0.98, and prognostic models that outperformed the European Society of Cardiology 4-strata risk assessment. The research demonstrates the potential of radiomics to provide non-invasive alternatives to right heart catheterization for PH diagnosis and risk stratification, potentially facilitating personalized treatment approaches.",
