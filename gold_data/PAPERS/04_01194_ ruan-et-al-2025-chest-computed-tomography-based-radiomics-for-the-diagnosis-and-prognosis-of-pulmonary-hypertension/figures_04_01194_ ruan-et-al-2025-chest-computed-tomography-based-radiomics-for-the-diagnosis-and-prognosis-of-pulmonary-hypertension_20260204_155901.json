      "description": "This figure presents a comprehensive analysis of predictive factors for pulmonary hypertension (PH) prognosis through forest plots and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. Panel A shows hazard ratios for radiomic features selected via LASSO regression, with RV (right ventricle) being the only statistically significant predictor (HR=1.04, p=0.004). Panel B displays survival curves comparing radiomic model (RM) and joint model (JM) performance in the derivation cohort, showing significant prognostic stratification (p<0.0001). Panels C and D present similar analyses for the validation cohort, where clinical features are included alongside radiomic features, though the validation results show less clear separation between risk groups and non-significant p-values (0.22 and 0.18).",

      "description": "This figure contains four panels (A-D) showing performance comparisons between radiomic models (RM), joint models (JM), and standard fourth-layer risk stratification for pulmonary hypertension prognosis prediction. Panels A and C display ROC curves with AUC values for derivation and validation cohorts respectively, while panels B and D show time-dependent AUC values over months for the same cohorts. The results demonstrate that different models perform variably over time, with some models showing better discrimination ability in certain time periods, and the validation cohort generally showing more variable performance compared to the derivation cohort.",
